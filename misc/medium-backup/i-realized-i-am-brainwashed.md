What does it mean to be brainwashed? Primarily, it means that you get manipulated on the level of emotions and beliefs to serve the interests of somebody else.

Usually, by referring to somebody as brainwashed, it means that somebody was manipulated to take a radical, unpopular, and wrong opinion to serve the interests of some shady party.

The reason I consider myself brainwashed is that I believe that I am manipulated to consider my country of origin with the current state of affairs both in politics and in the government to be more right in the current situation than the western mogul and its supporters.

**Realizing that I’m brainwashed allowed me to ask what a truly unwashed brain would be and what can I do to unwash my brain.**

### **What is an unwashed brain?**

Usually, you are not considered brainwashed when you support a popular opinion.

Where I’m from, the popular opinion is that in the West people live better than in the East. And the majority of people want to live better. So they want to go to the West.

When I was growing up I really loved the classic rock of the ‘80s and the ’90s that wasn’t very well appreciated by my peers from where I come from. In my imagination, the West was the place of this type of music, and if I go there, I would be able to play this type of music and be appreciated. When I came to the US, I was very disappointed to learn that the only music in demand there in the 2010s up to this day has been hip-hop. “Classic rock”-type music was long gone into the waters of oblivion and was only served at karaoke bars.

I was young and had many illusions. My pink glasses have soon come off when I started living in the states. But I believe that I was brainwashed to have these illusions.

But let’s take a step back, to be brainwashed is to be manipulated on the level of emotions and beliefs to serve the interest of someone else. This means NOT serving your own interest, but somebody else’s.

We all serve the interests of our families: mom’s, dad’s, spouse’s, children’s and so on. Often our family members manipulate us emotionally or otherwise. Especially this is the case for married people. Children are also good manipulators. Yet, we often don’t consider being brainwashed by them because we think that our interests align with theirs.

Now, a similar manipulation happens at the level of government. Governments manipulate people at the level of emotions and beliefs to serve the interests of the government. _No government serves the interest of the people beyond the bare minimum to avoid losing control, I hope that this is understood apriori by everybody._

**All I’m getting at is that it is impossible to not be brainwashed because you are always being manipulated on every level by different parties.**

Now some would say that all that is needed is to just isolate from the rest of the world and not play their manipulative games. And the funny part would be that this might be an exact outcome of being brainwashed, as this would really help those in charge to isolate and conquer.

Because you can’t be not brainwashed it would really be helpful to understand what your real interests are and how to make sure that the interests of those who brainwash you and your own align.

### What are my true interests?

Naturally, a philosophical question arises of what my true interests are. I think the obvious answer is to be happy. Now of course the chain of follow-up questions will ensue as to what true happiness is and so on. Let’s just call it the fulfillment of real needs and legitimate wants without going further into defining these.

For example, one particular person considers themselves happy when they have many friends they can hang out with (socialization needs), their family is supporting them (psychological needs), there are lots of fun things to do (entertainment needs), there are long-term goals (self-realization needs) and they dream of traveling the whole world (legitimate want stemming from curiosity and wonder). Or course, it’s important to mention that all the basic needs like food, shelter, and clothing are taken care of.

So the objective is to make sure that you need to choose who can manipulate you so you can get closer to being happy.

The problem is that, however, you often don’t know what’s in store. Those who manipulate you will always make it seem like they have all you need and want. So the only way to know is through interaction.

When looking back at my interaction with my home country and the US, I realize that being an immigrant in the US is way too tough, it makes realization of needs and wants very hard. So definitely those who think that the immigration would make them more happy need to think three times. However, your home country is a place where it is much easier to fulfill the needs, doesn’t mean it’s completely effortless of course.

This means that my country brainwashing still might be the best brainwashing option for me.

### The scary part

The scary part is that our countries are technically at war which poses an existential threat to my home country.

I realize that if something bad was going to happen to my home, I would be left in a situation where I’m worse than an immigrant I used to be with my identity being questioned, my needs and wants being ever harder to fulfill and lots of regrets about the cultural heritage that’s been lost.

Therefore, in my case, it is in my best interests to support my home country and being manipulated by it as opposed to being manipulated by the West.

### Conclusion

So let’s not be naive to think that we are free of being manipulated. If you think this, however, then ask yourself a question of whether it is beneficial for somebody to tap into your sense of independence and control. And then ask yourself whether it helps you in terms of happiness as defined above. I will definitely do the same.
