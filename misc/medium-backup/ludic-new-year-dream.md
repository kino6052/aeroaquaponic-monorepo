## Lucid New Yearâ€™s Dream

I had a dream this morning where I realized I was sleeping. I thought to myself that I probably should try flying, but as I started floating in the air, I felt a very familiar feeling that I felt when was in sleep paralysis and realized I wasn't safe. Not only that, but I also felt very fearful, so I had to say as prayer several times before I could snap back.

The dream was taking place in some rural area, where I was a student in some boarding school. I was walking at night along some road, where on one side of me was a hedge, behind it were south American children. They were eating and talking on the ground surrounded by shipping containers.

I didn't care much and just kept walking. On the road there were a lot of broken school tables and other furniture that I had to climb and jump to, over and from.

When I got back to the dormitory, I climbed a bunk bed. Once I did, a teacher told me that I need to be careful not to hit my head against the ceiling.

The teacher also told me that I haven't gone to the class for a while.

I then was in front of a mirror, where I started looking at myself. I realized that I look just like my dad, but my hair was for some reason very short, and it was the moment I realized I was dreaming, because I was certain I had longer hair.

I was fully conscious of the fact I was in a dream, and I thought that I should try something. The first thing that came to mind was flying of course. I flapped my hands like a pair of wings and started to glide through space going through the walls.

As I was gliding my eyes started twitching and the movement felt very jerky and unnatural. It felt just like the sleep paralysis. I got really scared that I might be very unsafe there if I stay much longer. I did not feel the evil presence, but I had no intention to risk getting stuck in this space.

I started to pray. First couple attempts were not helpful, I tried to snap out, but snapped into some dark space where I started hearing detuned harmonica with a melody similar to the Piano Man by Billy Joel, I prayed harder, it was pretty difficult for some reason, tried to cross myself, with my hands being pretty stiff, but was able to do it, so I finally got out.

Once I was out, my sense of perception was still a bit distorted and dissociated, vision was a bit fuzzy and space looked a bit unreal.

I'm so traumatized by my experiences with sleep paralysis that I will probably remain skeptical about lucid dreaming for the rest of my life.
