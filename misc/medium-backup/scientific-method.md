## Scientific Method

Here are some intuitions that I am aware of:

- I am real

- World is real

- Time is real

- Space is real

- People are real

- Reason is/can be correct

- Memory is/can be correct

- Senses are/can be correct

- Emotions/feelings are/can be correct

- Others are/can be correct

- World can be understood

- Language can correctly describe the world

I don’t know any of these to be true, but I find them very convincing. I am convinced by these intuitions.

However, these are subjective intuitions.

Objectiveness arises when multiple people agree on something. This stems from the intuitions that others are like us and that if they confirm our perception or point of view, then it is more convincing.

Now if we agree with:

**Nature of Truth — Axiom 3**

We lack the ability to possess the absolute truth

**Nature of Truth — Axiom 4**

Lack of our ability to possess the absolute truth requires us to resort to beliefs and trust. E.g. we can trust/distrust our senses, our reasoning, our intuitions, others, etc.

Then we will reserve beliefs to fundamental intuitions, that can be wrong or right.

In case of objective truth, this means that we need to share the same set of beliefs — that can be either true or false — and agreement on something that builds on top of them doesn’t guarantee to be true, it is just more convincing.

## Science

In empirical science, we are first of all sure that the world is true, and that it can conform to our reason. Now, we want to also make sure that our judgments about the world are the truest, and that they attain the highest level of necessity, which is the most convincing to reason.

For example, according to scientific intuitions, it is impossible to show that something doesn’t exist directly, but it is possible to show that something does exist. However, it is possible to show that something doesn’t exist indirectly — by showing that something does exist.
