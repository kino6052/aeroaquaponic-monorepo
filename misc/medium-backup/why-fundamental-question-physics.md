## “Why” — the most fundamental question behind Physics

### Intro

Richard Feynman is, perhaps, the most excellent example of a physicist who was able to communicate physics casually.

[In a video where Richard Feynman is asked to explain the magnetic force in simple terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp4dpeJVDxs), he acknowledges the apparent complexity behind the question of why.

“But the problem, you see, when you ask why something happens, how does a person answer why something happens?”

“And when you explain a why, you have to be in some framework that allows something to be true.”

Indeed, the question of why is very context-dependent, yet I would like to demonstrate an interesting and perhaps novel vantage point on this question from the standpoint of philosophical musings.

### Physics is the science of change

When we think of physics, we imagine all kinds of things: Einstein, the Solar system, quantum computers, galaxies, black holes, Large Hadron Collider, Rockets and so on.

What we forget, however, is that physics is really about one simple thing — change.

The wonderous Newton’s second law “F = ma” literally says that all we are interested in is Force, or, if paraphrased, in the change in velocity with a coefficient (mass).

But what is change?

If everything was static, it would be great, we would be done, nothing of interest here.

We introduce time and say that it only marches in a single direction and then introduce space and say that something can take up part of it and either stay at one spot at every point in time or advance in a set direction by a certain value.

Why would we need these introductions? Great question, I’m about to unveil the reason for this.

Now it is apparent, that we indirectly introduced a possibility of two things occupying the same space at the same time.

Now, let’s introduce yet another condition, things cannot take up same space at the same time.

Well, this is a problem. What can we do? How can we resolve this?

Let’s make the final introduction. To prevent things from occupying the same space at the same time, we have to adjust their linearity. And voila, we introduced the second-degree change or force.

By this, I want to illustrate that change is about the resolution of conflict. First-degree change introduces a possibility of conflict to the system. Second-degree change introduces means to resolution. But the point is that everything wants to be static or free of conflict or, in other words, complete.

Physics is about interaction, interaction is conflict resolution.

### Answering the why question

The reason I called the why question the most fundamental question in physics, is that under the hood this question is really asking about things that change.

Why question can rephrased as “what conflict is trying to be resolved”?

As you can see that this can be applied way outside of the domain of what we usually think of as physics.

In narratives when we ask “why was a given plot device taken?”, all we say is “what conflict is trying to be resolved?” and in this case it will be “reader started to get bored over the past couple pages”.

In nature when we ask “why animals eat grass?”, all we ask is “what conflict is trying to be resolved?” and in this case is that animals don’t want to die of starvation and they want to eat.

In chemistry when we ask “why compounds form?,” all we ask is “what conflict is trying to be resolved?” and in this case it will be “matter wants to be kept static (both in terms of motion or charge)).

### Does this need to be proven scientifically?

I want to demonstrate that this fundamental understanding does not need to be proven scientifically as it already contains logical necessity behind it.

I claim it impossible to ask a why question without mentioning a process.

The process is always about the second-degree change.

Second-degree change is always about conflict resolution, or at least if we are faithful to the presupposition of cause and effect.

### Conclusion

Why is a question that really asks “what conflict is trying to be resolved?” and you can’t think of a why question without thinking of a process. Everything process is about the second-degree change. And the second-degree change is what physics is about.
