## Meaning of Life

Every goal that we may have exists only because we are incomplete. If we were complete, then we wouldn’t have any goals. Therefore, completeness is the ultimate goal of our life, or otherwise, the meaning of our life.

However, because we are mortal, it means that our longing for completeness is an illusion.

From a biological standpoint, the longing for homeostasis exists on the level of a single being, as well as population. However, both are illusory, because this homeostasis is unable to be reached on either level because everything dies eventually.

**There is also an innate intuition, that bodily death doesn’t mean the death of our being**.

If we assume that this intuition is false, then life is essentially a trap, where your happiness will always be at the horizon, that will end at some point in something that you’ve been running away from all along.

Worth mentioning that suicide is very irrational, as suicide is usually taken as a measure to escape suffering and attain rest. Therefore, it is not the suicide that I may desire, but the escape from suffering and the attainment of rest.

Life in this sense is a total trap with no way out.

However, if the intuition is correct, then our being stays with a certain level of completeness even after bodily death.

Does this mean, however, that we can become complete forever, or are we destined to be eternally unfulfilled?
