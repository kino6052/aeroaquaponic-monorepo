In this chapter, I will try to synthesize the conclusions from the previous chapters and discuss how it all applies to personal life and well-being.

The key message of this book is that this world contains the fundamental contradiction of the inability to attain the completeness that all material things desire. Because of this, I should not focus on establishing a solid foundation in this world. Rather I need to improve the foundation of spirit and mind. I should improve my foundational understanding and improve my faith by disconnecting my heart from the phenomenal world and directing it to the search for escape from it.

An obvious consequence of trying to follow this road is an attempt to live humbly, as a minimalist. Possession binds us to the phenomenal world and makes us forget about the fact that this world will eventually betray us.

Some people choose to live beyond simplicity and eagerly search the escape. Those are monastics and ascetics. I consider this way of living a bit extreme. It is not for everyone. I don’t think I can live like this. It is often said there needs to be a calling for this way of life.

As I’m still experimenting and exploring, I’m not barring the door to the eager escape, but I’m more focused on seeing what my options are.

Currently, I am experimenting with a concept that I call a unit of self-sufficiency. Trying to establish a minimal but somewhat complete framework, that would allow me to better examine and understand my needs and the problems that arise as I try to fulfill them.

Unit of Self-Sufficiency is a model of collective human existence in which the basic, psychological, and self-realization needs of its least possible number of members are fulfilled with the necessary and sufficient amount of sustainable resources owned by the unit.

In this model, people live off of their land and possess various kinds of skills to solve their problems.

It is an idealistic model, so it requires grounding in experience. This is exactly why I am trying to develop a proof-of-concept to understand the possibilities and shortcomings of this concept.

I grew up in a city, and as such I have almost no skills, other than general problem-solving, that could help me to live such a lifestyle. So my family and I are slowly transitioning to this way of life. It is a very difficult process and along this process, a lot of mistakes are made and many problems are encountered.

However, this way of life seems to be a necessary part of building a better understanding of my relationship with the phenomenal world, myself, and others and will help to further enhance my understanding of this world.

This book addresses the goals outlined in the foreword, however, it also serves as a utility to prepare the ground for developing a curriculum that would be a necessary blueprint or a recipe for establishing such a unit. I want to systematically outline all the necessary knowledge required for the establishment of such a unit and provide hands-on projects that will gradually improve the skills necessary for this enterprise to succeed.

I hope that at some point I will be able to pass on my knowledge and understanding. I want to experience the process of giving education to developing minds as I am certain that it will further help me enhance my understanding.

To conclude this book, I want to remind myself that like in software I need to test (inquire and get data), implement (apply to your structure), and always refactor to make understanding simpler and clearer.

The only thing constant is change in the world of phenomena, and it is a core contradiction that lies at the root of everything that this phenomenal world is. This world will never get us all we want.

We need to escape this strange dream. We need God.
