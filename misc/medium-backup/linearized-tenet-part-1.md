## Linearized TENET: Part I

I would like to give my attempt to linearize the plot of the movie TENET based on the concept of meta-time as described [here](https://kirill-novik.medium.com/unofficial-and-speculative-guide-to-understanding-the-movie-tenet-minimal-spoilers-15c3f81e0cac).

Let’s try to understand where all of this story begins in the meta-time.

**Important to note **that I am going to use the terms **BEFORE **and **AFTER **in relation to the **meta-time ONLY**. However, in order to describe the **spacetime past and future**, I am going to use the terms **LEFT **and **RIGHT **respectively.

I don’t fully understand what the A9 (Algorithm) supposed to do when it inverts the Earth, but that’s for later…

Also, since only a supernatural being who can travel in the meta-time back and forth can really know the sequence of events in the movie, I can only guess a potential sequence of events in meta-time.

**Beginning**

- Terrorists from the distant RIGHT, relative to the events in the film, send a message and money to the LEFT, asking to create both the Algorithm and the Turnstile to allow people in the LEFT to travel in LEFT and RIGHT directions as a tool to ensure that the Algorithm is assembled by creating the “temporal pincer movement” effect.

- Young Andrey Sator finds the message and the money as a maintenance worker or a miner at a nuclear material mine in the uncharted Soviet town of Stalsk-12 in northern Siberia.

**First Steps as a Gangster**

- Upon reading the message, Sator kills other witnesses and keeps the money and instructions to himself.

- Sator becomes an influential gangster

- He succeeds in building a turnstile(s).

- As he begins the search after the nine pieces of the Algorithm he faces problems

- As he sees his team getting the first piece (on some guarded territory?) he notices all of the details of what went wrong

**Two Sators**

- After the initial unsuccessful attempt of trying to get the piece, he travels LEFT in time, sees himself on the LEFT, and tells all of this to his LEFT self.

- Now there are two Sators

- RIGHT Sator then goes back to the RIGHT and sees that everything is successful

- Two Sators then proceed to get other pieces

- One of the Sators then travels RIGHT, then comes back to the LEFT and tells his LEFT self all of the information

- He does so multiple times

- None of the two Sators realize that they are being watched by the secret services in the meantime

**Busted**

- At some point the turnstile gets uncovered by the secret service

- As Sator wants to tell his LEFT selves that they got busted, he fails to do so

- Now that both RIGHT Sator and the secret service are at the LEFT side, the other LEFT Sator possibly doesn’t hear back from the RIGHT Sator and understands that something went wrong.

- Secret service agent/troop from the RIGHT that went through the turnstile arrests one of the Sators, and spreads the information about the turnstiles.

- Sator wants to go LEFT in time and kill the secret service agent as he gets out of the turnstile, but he’s too late, and the secret service blocks his way to the turnstile

- Now one of the turnstiles belongs exclusively to the secret service

- Sator rushes to another turnstile to get ahead of them and get back to the LEFT and kill the secret service agent

- However, the secret service sends the troops to the LEFT to stop Sator at the very beginning

- As they get to the beginning of the Sator’s plan, Sator is also travelling to the LEFT

**Sator Escapes**

- As they bust Sator on the LEFT, Sator from the RIGHT gets out more to the LEFT of them and lets his LEFT self know to run away

- Later, the troop gets ambushed and killed by Sator

- Then the rest of the troop on the RIGHT that was waiting for their LEFT colleagues gets ambushed and killed by Sator

**Sator’s Success**

- The secret service now understands the full gravity of the situation because there are possibly at least the same number of Sators as there are turnstiles

- Sator easily gets all of the nine pieces of the algorithm and sets it in Stalsk-12

- However, he decides that he doesn’t want to set the mechanism off quite yet and decides to attach the switch that sets off the Algorithm to his heart so that the world dies with him

- Possibly as many other as there are Sators did the same

- He goes back in time with the A9 to make sure the secret service isn’t able to stop him

**Movie Begins**

- The secret service took advantage of the fact that Sator decided to take it easy and sent the troops to the turnstile

- They got LEFT to the event where Sator stole an A9 piece, although the A9 has already been assembled, from the Ukrainian opera and this is where the movie pretty much begins

This interpretation might seem crazy, but it is the one that I arrived at so far.
