## Unofficial and Speculative Guide to Understanding the Movie Tenet (Minimal Spoilers)

The reason why it is hard to understand this movie is that its events as well as its conceptual framework are deliberately made intricately interwoven. It is to confuse you by design.

## Core concept

I think it is important to understand where to even begin thinking about this movie.

**The core concept behind the movie is the ability to communicate or exchange information between the past and the future.**

Let’s say that in the future there is no more water. However, there is a technology that allows turning matter into an inverted matter that travels back in time. Somebody sends a letter and money into the past, let’s not focus on the details for the sake of argument, that gets picked up by somebody in the past where there is water. Let’s say they are convinced that this letter is from the future, and they decide to store water where the future people indicated in the letter. Now, the people from the future, after “sending” that letter, go to see if the water is there, and “boom,” the water is actually there, and it’s been there for a long time.

This is impossible to understand in terms of cause and effect in regular time because a future action causes something that has already happened in the past.

However, this still could be explained if we consider space and time in Einstein’s way, as a space-time manifold, or just a four-dimensional structure. Don’t try too hard to visualize it! It may only make it harder to understand! Though, in this framework, you can think of the planet as a giant hotdog, where its length is in the dimension of time.

Now, if we add a “meta-time” dimension to this framework, all the cause and effect will work as expected. In this framework, actions in the normal time and reversed time cause changes along the length of the hotdog.

**The movie’s model of reality is five-dimensional.**

Let’s take a look at the example above, but this time in terms of meta-time.

If the spacetime planet is a hotdog, then to the left is the past, and to the right is the future.

**Cause: **The person on the right side sends a message to the left side.

**Effect:** The person on the left receives it.

**Cause:** The person on the left sends the response to the right side.

**Effect: **The person on the right receives it.

This is only sequential in terms of meta-time, and not spacetime. In terms of meta-time spacetime changes sequentially, but in terms of spacetime, everything happens at the same time.

## Why the grandfather paradox doesn’t work in this framework

If you were able to understand the argumentation above, it should be obvious to you why the grandfather paradox doesn’t work in this framework.

**Cause: **Grandson goes from the right side (future) to the left side (past)

**Effect:** Grandson arrives on the left side (past)

**Cause:** Grandson makes sure that his grandfather doesn’t meet his grandma

**Effect: **There is no grandson on the right side (future), but there is on the left (past)

Cause and effect DO work in this reference frame, but the grandfather paradox DOES NOT. However, spacetime is altered in meta-time by such shenanigans.

## What are some quirks of such an inversion?

**Cloning**

Since in such a framework it is possible to have two of you — one from the future, and the other one from the present, it is also possible to have an infinite amount of you in this framework.

Cause: You go from the right side to the left side

Effect: There are two of you on the left side

Cause: The one who just went from the right to the left goes to the left again after some time

Effect: There are three of you on the left side

Cause: One more time to the left

Effect: There are four of you on the left side

Cause: … You get it …

**Manipulation of space-time**

If you can travel in spacetime’s time direction you can shape the future as you like.

However, you can also use it for purposes of destruction.

In the movie, the protagonist tries to make sure that the past and the future aren’t destroyed.

## How does the TENET organization make sure that the future isn’t destroyed?

The main trick that they use in the movie, in order to ensure that the past and the future are stable, is by creating “pincers”. It is an exchange of information between the past and the future to ensure something happens within the pincer’s timeframe

**Cause:** I go to the left side from the right side

**Effect: **I and my past self are on the left side

**Cause: **I tell myself that everything is fine 10 minutes into the future

**Effect: **If I’m not lying, then as long as my future self doesn’t interfere with anything, you can assume that the next 10 minutes are going to be fine. But I only assume this, because, remember, that it is theoretically possible that the future self can kill me

As long as this exchange of information happens there are two things that are certain:

1.  The past is fine

2.  The next 10 minutes are most likely to be fine if the future self to be trusted

## Conclusion

The time travel concept in the movie TENET can be understood as a linear cause-and-effect story presented in a broken-narrative manner. However, it requires certain assumptions to be made. I believe that I was able to demonstrate that considering TENET’s reality as a spacetime manifold in meta-time serves these purposes well. As a result, in this framework, we don’t need to speculate about free-will and parallel universes.

**From this standpoint, I would like to challenge Mr. Nolan to create a linear meta-time narrative version of TENET. Please… 🙏🙏🙏**
