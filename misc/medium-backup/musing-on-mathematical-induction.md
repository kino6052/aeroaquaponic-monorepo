## Musings on Mathematical Induction

When trying to prove something, we need to show that something **must necessarily follow **from the argument.

What possesses necessity in mathematics?

1.  Axioms of a given field (set theory, algebra, etc.)

2.  Logic

When we try to prove something by induction in discrete math, we try to show that:

1.  If a \*statement s**\* **holds for all positive integers up to an _integer k_

2.  Then if it also holds for the next _integer k+1_

3.  Then the *statement s *holds for all positive integers NOT up to an integer k, but _k+1_

4.  However, because k+1 can be represented as an integer of the same form as in step 1, the proof becomes cyclical and unterminated.

5.  Since the proof is unterminated, it must hold for the infinity.

When showing step 2, it is the algebraic form that should exhibit the property that satisfies _statement s._ One of the simplest properties to demonstrate is parity.
