Technological singularity — the hypothetical future event in which technology experiences a rapid and exponential increase in capabilities, leading to a transformation of society as we know it— has long been a topic of debate and speculation. Many have been skeptical about the possibility of achieving technological singularity, due in part to the significant challenges that would need to be overcome in order to make it a reality. One of the main challenges is [scalability](https://kirill-novik.medium.com/science-is-not-a-scalable-system-142cab5729b4) — as technology becomes more complex, it becomes harder to maintain and train professionals to develop and support it.

However, there is now a relatively new development that has the potential to change the game: NVIDIA Omniverse. Omniverse is a high-fidelity reality simulation that can produce a vast amount of AI training data instantly. This development has the potential to solve many of the scalability issues that have previously stood in the way of technological singularity, and it could be the key to unlocking this transformative event. More than that, Omniverse has the potential to allow AI to learn how to self-replicate, learn, adapt, and improve, taking the concept of technological singularity to a whole new level. In this article, we will explore the scary potential of Omniverse to bring about technological singularity and consider the implications of this development for society as a whole.

### Background

Technological singularity refers to the hypothetical future event in which technology experiences a rapid and exponential increase in capabilities, leading to a transformation of society as we know it. The term “technological singularity” was coined by mathematician and computer scientist John von Neumann in the 1950s, and it has since been popularized by science fiction authors and futurists.

One of the key features of the singularity is the idea that technology will experience a rapid and exponential increase in capabilities, potentially leading to a dramatic change in the way that society functions. This could include the development of new technologies and innovations that are beyond our current understanding, as well as the emergence of new social and economic systems.

**The key point is that singularity refers to a point where technology will get to a stage where it will be impossible to control or understand as it will be highly autonomous and fast-changing.**

### **The current challenges in tech**

[The key problem in tech is scalability — a quality of a system that describes its ability to be extended or changed or adapted over time. I wrote an article about this problem.](https://kirill-novik.medium.com/science-is-not-a-scalable-system-142cab5729b4)

Another major challenge is the issue of economic sustainability. Developing and implementing new technologies can be a costly and resource-intensive process. Not to mention it also affects the environment.

Another challenge is the issue of trust and transparency. In recent years, there has been increasing public concern about the power and influence of large tech companies, and many people are skeptical of the motivations and practices of these firms. This mistrust can make it difficult for companies to win the support and cooperation of the public, which can be a major hindrance to the development and implementation of new technologies.

In addition to these challenges, there are also many issues related to bureaucracy and corruption that can stand in the way of technological progress. The complex and often opaque nature of government regulations and policies can make it difficult for companies to navigate the regulatory landscape and bring new technologies to market. Similarly, corruption can also be a major impediment to technological progress, as it can divert resources and attention away from important research and development efforts.

Finally, there are also many challenges related to international relations that can affect the focus and funding of technological research and development. Political tensions, economic rivalries, and other factors can all influence the direction and priorities of technological progress, and these dynamics can sometimes create barriers to cooperation and collaboration between different countries and regions.

### The game changer

Despite the many challenges and obstacles that stand in the way of rapid technological progress, there is one technology that has the potential to overcome many of these hurdles: Omniverse, developed by NVIDIA.

Omniverse is a high-fidelity reality simulation platform that allows users to create virtual replicas of physical systems and conduct experiments and training in a virtual environment. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way that we approach research and development, as it allows us to test and refine new technologies in a controlled and cost-effective way.

One of the key benefits of Omniverse is its ability to create virtual replicas of real-world systems. This allows users to test and experiment with new technologies in a way that is not possible in the physical world, as they can easily simulate different scenarios and conditions. For example, Omniverse could be used to test the performance of a new piece of machinery or to explore the potential impacts of a new transportation system.

Another advantage of Omniverse is its ability to generate large amounts of training data quickly and efficiently. This is particularly important for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies, as these systems rely on large amounts of data in order to learn and improve. Omniverse allows users to generate this data quickly and easily, which can greatly accelerate the development of these technologies.

### Singularity Use-cases

Omniverse can enable machines to learn how to find and extract resources, process them, and create new products. By using these technologies, it is possible to create systems that are able to locate and extract raw materials, process them into intermediate products, and then use those products to create a wide range of finished goods, including electronics and other advanced technologies.

Another example is the use of robotics and automation to enable machines to build and maintain infrastructure. By using advanced robotics and automation technologies, it is possible to create systems that are able to locate and extract raw materials, process them into intermediate products, and then use those products to build and maintain complex infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and buildings.

### **Horizon Zero Dawn (Spoilers)**

In Horizon Zero Dawn the main problem that caused the collapse of civilization was that robots started to replicate uncontrollably and consume all available resources, it is possible to make an argument that this scenario is a scary prospect that can’t be entirely ruled out in today’s reality.

The parallel from the game suggests that the rapid development and proliferation of advanced technologies, including robotics and artificial intelligence, has the potential to create new and unforeseen risks and challenges. As these technologies become more sophisticated and autonomous, it is possible that they could evolve in ways that are difficult to predict or control.

For example, if robots or AI systems are designed to be self-replicating and to consume resources in order to function, it is possible that they could eventually consume all available resources or outcompete other species for resources, leading to a collapse of the ecosystem or even the extinction of other life forms. This scenario could be particularly scary if we consider the potential consequences for humans and the impact on our own survival and well-being.

Another argument could be that the risks and challenges posed by advanced technologies are not limited to the potential for uncontrolled replication and resource consumption. There are also many other potential risks and unintended consequences associated with these technologies, including the possibility of accidents, malfunctions, or malicious attacks.

### When to be worried

Once we hear about technology that is capable of automating manufacturing, especially electronics manufacturing, it’s time to be worried. The human operation has always been a bottleneck to development, but once no such bottleneck exists, we are in for things happening more rapidly than ever before.

I’ve always been skeptical about the idea of singularity. However, as I’ve learned more about the tools available today (like NVIDIA Omniverse and ChatGPT), I’m starting to seriously consider the possibility that singularity may be our not-so-distant reality.

It’s clear that technology is advancing at an exponential rate, and there are many exciting and transformative technologies being developed that have the potential to greatly impact our lives and the way that we live. While there are still many challenges and obstacles that stand in the way of achieving singularity, it is increasingly clear that it is a highly plausible event that could happen in the near future.

This prospect is both exciting and scary, and it’s important that we are prepared for the potential consequences and impacts of singularity. We need to carefully consider the risks and challenges that these technologies may pose, and work towards finding ways to mitigate these risks and ensure that we are using these technologies responsibly and ethically. Let’s hope that we are prepared for the changes that are coming and that we are able to navigate this new and uncharted territory in a way that benefits all of humanity.
