## Proof: The Square Root of Two is Irrational

I would like to show a simple non-algebraic proof that √2 is an irrational number.

**Proof**

**√2 is not integer** because 1²< 2, and 2²>2, and every following number squared is even larger because every consecutive square is larger than its predecessor.

Therefore, **√2 is either rational or irrational number.**

**Let’s suppose √2 is rational. **In other words, there exists a rational number of form k/m, where k and m are natural numbers in most reduced form, and m > 1, such that (k/m)²=2.

However, rational numbers of that form don’t give integers when squared because that could only happen when m= 1.

This contradicts the assumptions and, therefore, means that **√2 is irrational.**

**General Proof**

The reason I decided to show a non-standard proof first was that I find the original proof less intuitive, for a person without a developed mathematical intuition. Mainly, because when you set out to prove that √2 is irrational, my expectations are such that I expect the numbers in the ratio to exhibit some contradictory properties, and not the ratio itself, especially not in the form that the ratio may have a common factor. The appearance of a common factor isn’t something I expect at all when I set out to discover the proof.

**Here’s the Proof**

**So how to make this proof a bit more intuitive?**

I want to change the phrasing of the assumptions.

Let’s suppose that two integers p and q have the most reduced form, **and also **one of these is true:

- p is odd and q is even

- q is odd and p is even

- both p and q are odd

However, we very soon realize that **both are even**, and **it is immediately apparent that there is a contradiction.**

Let’s also imagine that nothing could have been done about this, and the proof was absolutely counterintuitive. What could I learn about this for future mathematical adventures?

It is extremely important to know the minutiae of the assumptions you are making because if you are going to find a contradiction, it could be any of those details. This requires a lot of attention to detail.
