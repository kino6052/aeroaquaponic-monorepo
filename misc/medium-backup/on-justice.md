## On Justice

## Justice

Justice is a relation between at least two selves, where both need each other for completion, and they perceive such a need and help each other to fulfill it.

**Axiom: **Self has a need for justice

This need for justice can be termed “**conscience.**”

The relation between individuals has completion as its goal.

Kant’s categorical imperative can be rephrased as such that **moral goodness is when everybody perceives the completion of others as related to the completion of self.**

These help to explain the nature of self-sacrifice whether that be on a battlefield or in daily-life.

**Gratitude **is a perception of need in another in combination with wanting to reward for their help.

## Injustice

Injustice is when the completion of either party of this relation is compromised in favor of one or the other.

Also, there can be aberrations when a self who has a need in another denies it. This can happen due to the wrong perception of the relation in several ways.

**Envy **is an aberration of perception of the relation of two or more selves when one of them perceives that the other possesses something unduly, and/or “stole” it from you.

**Pride **is an aberration of perception of the relation of two or more selves when one of them perceives that they don’t have a need in a relation.

If one person has the power to take something from another to fulfill the completion at disadvantage to the other, this person would do that if the mutual advantage is not perceived toward completion. Thus there can be no justice without the balance of power.

## Law

Law is a set of rules/a contract that enables punishment for a breach of such contract. And since punishment is perceived against completion, it prevents such breach.

Law can either be directed toward the goal of completion of all parties or away. The more it is directed toward, the more just it is, and the more true it is.

Law has a downside. Because of it, punishment may be perceived as primary to the fulfillment of needs.
