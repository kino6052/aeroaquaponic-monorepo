## Overview

This book is a philosophical memoir that explores how **change** shapes our understanding of the world. Through personal anecdotes, philosophical inquiry, and practical reflections, it argues that truth is a dynamic construct—one we refine through introspection, experience, and resilience.

### Key Themes

- **Philosophy as Introspection**: Questioning assumptions to build a coherent worldview.
- **Faith & Science**: Reconciling spirituality with empirical inquiry.
- **The Paradox of Change**: Why impermanence is the foundation of growth.
- **Living Minimally**: Simplifying life to focus on what matters.

  - _The Music Dream_: Naivety, creative failure, and lessons from the "meat grinder" of ambition.
- **Core Idea**: Misconceptions create chaos; rebuilding requires starting from scratch.

#### Chapter 2: Philosophy

- **Explorations**:
  - Descartes’ _Cogito ergo sum_ and the certainty of self.
  - Kant’s _phenomenal world_ vs. absolute reality.
  - Critique of academic philosophy as system-preservation.
