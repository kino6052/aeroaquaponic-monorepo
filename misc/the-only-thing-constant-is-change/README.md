    - Introduction
      - Book purpose
        - To service as a snapshot of understanding
          - This book serves as a snapshot of my thoughts and understanding.
          - It is about how philosophy influenced me up to the present moment, because, as this book suggests, everything is a subject to change including understanding.
          - Most of all, it preserves thoughts that I consider valuable
        - To demonstrate that understanding of the world is a personal construct
          - We build it over the course of our lives similar to software
          - I will provide my understanding of a variety of topics
            - Faith
              - What I believe and why
            - Science
              - Math
              - Physics
              - Biology
              - Computer Science
                - Especially significant, as it is something I do professionally
                - Influenced my world view
                - When programming we create constructs and we revise them so often, so many times
                - Programming, with its constant revisions, is a form of applied philosophy.
        - To demonstrate that a well-formed understanding allows for happier life
          - Can help answering questions
            - What can I know?
            - What ought I do?
            - What can I hope for?
            - What is the meaning of life?
            - What is happiness?
        - To demonstrate a process of getting to such an understanding
          - To demonstrate the value of philosophical reflexive introspection as a means of finding fundamental knowledge
          - To demonstrate that we can't have "the true" understanding
          - To explain why philosophy deserves why philosophy deserves more homage than it gets
        - To outline the path forward and encourage the reader to follow their own journey
          - Express hope that if I am careful I will eventually reduce misconceptions in the construct and it will keep improving
          - Express hope that this construct might help others in critically examining their own constructs
    - Part 1: Foundation
      - Chapter 1: Prior to understanding
        - Foreword
          - It wouldn't be worthwhile to write a book if there wasn't some mechanism or construct
            - which I find valuable
            - which I want to preserve through demonstration
            - which I want to share
          - This system is a mechanism that was assembled from principles (or base components)               
            - Will have its flaws
            - Might prove insightful
          - Base components
            - I would not be able to put together most basic components if I didn't start completely from scratch
            - It was only possible through thorough philosophical introspective reflection
        - Basic components
          - Introspective exposition
            - Why would we need to concern with such
              - Historic context
                - It was part of putting together the messy puzzle of misconceptions that I found myself in when I was younger and completely confused about life, my relationship with it and others
                  - Illustration
                    - Description
                      - To put things into perspective and demonstrate how misconceptions affected me personally, would worth to provide a few anecdotes from personal life. 
                    - Living abroad
                      - Expectations
                        - When my family and I started living in the United States, in the beautiful state of Colorado, I thought that that was it, everything was going be downhill from here, and things will only get better and cooler from now on.
                          - My brother and I were around 20 years of age. Super young. Full of energy. Somewhat talented. Full of misconceptions that were instilled in us by the globalist society (more on that later), and I wasn't really against those misconceptions back then, they were such attractive misconceptions. My brother and I were perfect candidates for entering the meat grinder of dreams.
                          - We expected nothing less than becoming the next world sensation that everybody would talk about
                            - I know, it's very modest. But at least it's honest.
                            - However, let's be honest and admit that we all are either a covert celebrity, covert billionaire whose time hasn't come yet or in some cases a spiritual being that has transcended the worldly desires and is already partaking of the pleasures beyond this world.
                              - Of course I'm being sarcastic.
                      - Reality
                        - The reality, however, hit soon enough. 
                        - Living in an English speaking country, you realize that English that you learned in school is no English at all.
                          - You have to forget everything you learned and learn from scratch.
                          - It is extremely humiliating.
                            - When you thought you were interesting and cool
                            - All of a sudden you speak like a 1 year old that isn't particularly talented
                            - Of course the language improved gradually, but at a much slower pace than you would imagine 
                        - Without language, and even with it, it is relatively hard to make meaningful connections with people
                          - All your friends back home are now on the other side of the globe and you are on you own
                          - Because we were already too old for being high school students, yet not residents of the state to attend a college at reasonable prices
                                - Our only option was to stay home, volunteer a little bit at food pantry and to attend ESL (English as a second language) classes.
                                - Not only was this rather boring, but also not contributing to the language learning.
                                - The first year of living in the U.S. was probably the worst year in my life 
                        - All of your habits that you are used to in your country of origin are either considered weird and sometimes even illegal
                          - I remember that when my dad was teaching my brother and I to drive a car in the parking space of a mall, somebody called the police
                            - When they arrived, they stopped our car and made us step out of the car and make my dad explain the situation
                            - Of course when you don't know English very well, you are super nervous
                            - So it was a very unpleasant thing to realize that simple things, or things that we were used to back home, are now requiring extra planning and consideration.
                            - It made us second-guess almost every move.
                        - To advance to a high degree of skill, you will have to become humble
                          - Only around 5-6 years after coming to the United States and studying in the University (which was hard), we learned English well
                        - Preliminary conclusion
                          - I imagined that assimilating in another country would be difficult, but I could imagine that it would be undescribably and unimaginably difficult. Teeth-grindingly difficult. The only description that comes to mind describing what reality held -- impossibly difficult.
                            - I later saw this movie "Princess Bride," that has a very fitting line that rings true with the experience:
                              - Life is pain. Anyone who says differently is selling something.
                    - Childhood dream of becoming a rock star
                      - Expectations
                        - As a dream of living easy in another country wasn't foolish enough, there was yet even more foolish dream.
                        - The dream of becoming a rock star. To be a part of the biggest rock (or pop) band.
                          - Of course I knew how to play instruments enough to be dangerous
                          - Of course I liked the material that me and my brother were putting out 
                      - Reality
                        - The reality was such that all our conceptions of music were a child play.
                          - We had material
                            - We had a couple of tunes that we didn't know how to put out into the world
                            - We played live only at open mics and not very often.
                            - We never found other band members (other than us two)
                            - Recording was so much work.
                              - The music we were recording was just demos.
                              - They were not fit for the real world audience
                          - We didn't have skills of promoting our band or even had any people that were interested in us or our cause
                            - Laziness
                              - We didn't do much to organize our band
                              - We expected that it will come naturally
                            - Introversion
                              - We were more comfortable in our own little world and fantasies than interacting with the outside world
                          - Wrong cause
                            - What we really enjoyed is the process of music creation
                            - We thought that that itself was enough, the golden goose that people will be attracted to like fruit-flies
                            - We were not performers
                              - Performance was a side goal and more theoretical
                            - What we really wanted, as it turned out, was karaoke
                              - It allowed for low stake music performance that we craved
                              - Karaoke gave us the fulfillment that we were searching in music
                              - Of course, it didn't make us rock stars, but when you on a stage singing your favorite songs, you are already living your best dream
                          - Realities of music industry
                            - Music industry is a meat grinder
                            - People in it are squeezed dry by the life-styles and the outright satanic ideology that encourages them to spin their wheels till they drop dead while infecting others to do the same
                              - But more on that later
                      - Preliminary conclusion
                        - We had a siloed and naive understanding of entering the music industry that in a sense protected us from being squeezed dry by the terrible industry without giving any return on investment.
                        - It was a learning experience, but it just showed how easy it was for us to be manipulated emotionally
                        - I believe that emotions are part of the magic sauce that gave us our talents, but they often clouded our minds and caused more pain that offering a solution. 
                    - Extra illustrations of misconceptions
                      - "Adult content is a natural thing" 18+ (find in the appendix)
              - Problem
                - The point here is simple - the mess in your concepts manifests in the mess in your life
              - Solution
                - To unravel the ball of yarn of misconceptions, you sometimes have to start from scratch
                - Because you can't build a solid structure on top of a shaky foundation
      - Chapter 2: Philosophy
        - Beginnings
          - What can I be absolutely certain of?
            - Is this the real life or is it just fantasy?
              - Do I know that I exist?
                - "Cogito ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am) as a foundational belief.
                - Seemingly not useful knowledge, but it can hint at a much more fundamental shift in understanding of everything
                  - If I know that I exist, but I don't know whether other things really exist
                  - Ultimately, I know nothing other than what is "shown" to me via experience.
                    - Is what is "shown" real? Or some sort of fantasy?
                    - Do I know that the world exist?
                      - I can tell for sure is that what I call the world is an experience
                        - Moreover it is an experience that I believe to be true
                          - Fundamental intuition
                            - Upon examination, I can't be certain of its existence
                              - Not to the degree I can be certain of my existence
                              - Because it is dreamlike
                                - In dreams we also believe that the world is true
                                - Upon waking up, we find it strange how real to us it seemed
                            - But I have certain very strong and crude sensations and feelings/intuitions that force me to believe it is real
                              - I can't control them, but they control me
                                - Memory
                                  - Makes me believe that there is past
                                - Fantasy
                                  - Makes me believe that there is future
                                - Sensations
                                  - Pain
                                    - Hunger
                                    - ...
                              - But even if I am certain that they affect me somehow, I still can't know whether they are real or some kind of fantasy that will evaporate eventually
                    - Allows for setting the reference frame (like Copernican shift in Immanuel Kant's philosophy) from focusing on reality to our own mind, if we speak in the modern terms, or soul if we speak from the classical standpoint   
                      - This reference frame will later proof to be the most solid foundation for building the structure of understanding that we are after 
        - What is philosophy
          - This introspection is really what philosophy is about

              - Examination
                - "Unexamined life is not worth living"
                - Of mind
                  - We already mentioned the importance of the vantage point of personal existence
                    - Examining one's mind is exactly the examination required for philosophy 
                  - Discoveries in mind could either be
                    - Key to understanding anything
                    - Path to delusions
              - Like academic philosophy in personal philosophy we build
                - System
                  - If you won't build a coherent and all encompassing system over the course of your life, then your understanding will always be fragmented and kaleidoscopic
                    - Not every system will do, but only the one that is as true to experience is possible
                    - But if you are in pursuit of the true understanding
                      – You will not stop on fragmented understanding
                - Method
                  - You will develop a way to enhance and elaborate on your knowledge
                    - Building ontologies
                    - Critically examining
                    - Doubting
                    - Etc.
                - On our own
                  - True philosophers are destined to be more or less lonely as the constructs we are creating are constant subject to change and complete revision, and in academia, constructs are guarded from shattering as the maintenance of these constructs is often the purpose of the academia
              - Philosophy is always about epistemology
                - Always about the search for the truth
                  - Main problem
                    - Not easy to determine what is truth and what is just an appearance
                - Immanuel Kant went farthest than other philosophers in epistemic understanding
                  - we can only know either what is imprinted in our minds from birth (apriori)
                  - Or something from the phenomenal word that is validated by experience
                    - Knowledge only in relative terms because experience is limited in time and space and could never become absolute
                - Ethics
                  - Builds on epistemology
                    - We can only know what is good interaction or bad interaction if we know something to be true or false
                - Aesthetics
                  - We know something to be good for us or bad for us, only if we know what is true
              - Philosophy will inevitably contain contradictions
                - Immanuel Kant
                  - Demonstrated that something that stands behind the world of phenomena (phenomena maps very well to our mind, but not whatever stands behind it, and there must, as at least because we know that we are certain of apriori things are a sort of phenomenon with different modalities, which tells us that phenomena are analogous to our soul products), is something that is out of reach, and because phenomena only hint at what lies behind, they don't have the power of telling us what it really is.
                  - The limitations of the expressiveness of phenomena is the source of contradictions to the mind
                    - It makes the mind suffer as it doesn't want to stop just here, but if it isn't grounded properly, it will wander off into delusions.
              - Futility
                - Admitting that our knowledge is always limited the search for the ultimate truth might seem futile
                  - Absolute knowledge itself (apriori knowledge) is not always useful
                    - Non-applied mathematics
                    - Non-applied logic
                  - Never ending process of accumulating "relative" (not absolute) knowledge
                    - Even building understanding is a relative knowledge, as it is a process
                - Justification
                  - The process of finding the truth is really futile
                    - If believe that the ever-changing and uncertain world
                      – Is all there is
                      – There is no way out
                  - It is not futile
                    - If there is a justification for a way out

          - Immanuel Kant
          - Plato
        - Materialism contains contradictions
          - Materialism only concerns with what is immediately perceivable
          - It doesn't concern itself with mind and its necessities, only body and nervous system
            - Does not satisfy individual's desire for meaning
        - Proper idealism does not contain contradictions
          - It is a solid foundation that can be built on top of
            - Even if there really was a world-in-itself, having an idealist vantage point would still be the most solid foundation for reasoning in general and a secure starting point in any discourse
              - As was clearly demonstrated by Immanuel Kant, using the reference frame of our mind is the only way we can make sense of things
        - The phenomenal world (the world of phenomenons)
          - We can only know from experience
          - At its core is change because time and space are conditions of our experience
          - Our minds are also part of phenomenal world, as they reveal themselves in time and is subject to change
          - Essentially, we as spirits (or minds or consciousness) have access to at least two "windows" through which we see things
          - We experience mind and the world somewhat differently
            - Mind
              - We have access to a wide variety of interactions and experiments can be done rather quickly
            - World
              - Our interactions are much more limited and are rather slow
      - Chapter 4: Change
        - The understanding of the phenomenal world requires the concept of change at its foundation
        - Is the core contradiction and problem of the phenomenal world
        - Everything is trying to attain "completeness", but it can't
        - There is always "incompleteness" that makes things change
        - I also call incompleteness "conflict" (conflict of interests if you will, as everything is trying to become complete, but is in conflict with other things in that goal)
        - Often, take matter for example, things try to resolve this conflict in a "greedy" fashion (in computer science terms it means that it goes for the first option that is available)
        - Stability
          - Generalities or thinking in general (broad) terms
        - Conflicts in this world are resolved in space and time
          - Varying proximity
            - Avoiding conflict by being far away from it (e.g. planets in a solar system)
            - Resolving conflict by being close to it (e.g. cells working together in an organism)
    - Part 2: Building on top of the foundation
      - Chapter 5: Faith
        - Happiness
          - Completeness
            - Faith is one of our foundational needs
        - Meaning of life
        - Religion
          - Patterns behind religions
            - Completeness lies outside this world
            - The other world doesn't have the same problems that we do here
              - Majority of religions
                - Other world is similar to this one (changing, not complete)
              - Few religions
                - Escape is complete and fulfilling
                  - Christianity
                  - Budhism
            - Requirements to escape exist  
      - Chapter 6: Science
      - Chapter 7: Education
        - advice to the young: the most important thing in the physical (no spiritual realm) is to have a steady influx of reward (dopamine pr whatever) and sustainable  long-term orientation (grit), then both happiness and achievement will follow
      - Chapter 8: Living in the ever-changing world (path forward and encouragement)
        - Minimalism 
        - Unit of self-sufficiency
    - Conclusion
      - Test (inquire and get data), Implement (apply to your structure), Refactor on repeat
      - The only thing constant is change in the world of phenomenons, and it is a core contradiction that lies at the root of everything, including good and evil
      - Although the world of phenomenons is often considered "material world", it may not be
        - Believing in substantiality of matter is full of contradictions and I concur on this with Berkley
        - Matter is an abstraction, not something concrete
        - Matter is a concept, not an object
        - As such, we can hope that the death is not the end
        - However, how can we escape this core contradiction that is the change?
          - We surely can't hope to do so by ourselves
          - We need God
