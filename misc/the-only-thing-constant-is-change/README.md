    - Introduction
      - Book purpose
        - To service as a snapshot of understanding
          - This book serves as a snapshot of my thoughts and understanding.
          - It is about how philosophy influenced me up to the present moment, because, as this book suggests, everything is a subject to change including understanding.
          - Most of all, it preserves thoughts that I consider valuable
        - To demonstrate that understanding of the world is a personal construct
          - We build it over the course of our lives similar to software
          - I will provide my understanding of a variety of topics
            - Faith
              - What I believe and why
            - Science
              - Math
              - Physics
              - Biology
              - Computer Science
                - Especially significant, as it is something I do professionally
                - Influenced my world view
                - When programming we create constructs and we revise them so often, so many times
                - Programming, with its constant revisions, is a form of applied philosophy.
        - To demonstrate that a well-formed understanding allows for happier life
          - Can help answering questions
            - What can I know?
            - What ought I do?
            - What can I hope for?
            - What is the meaning of life?
            - What is happiness?
        - To demonstrate a process of getting to such an understanding
          - To demonstrate the value of philosophical reflexive introspection as a means of finding fundamental knowledge
          - To demonstrate that we can't have "the true" understanding
          - To explain why philosophy deserves why philosophy deserves more homage than it gets
        - To outline the path forward and encourage the reader to follow their own journey
          - Express hope that if I am careful I will eventually reduce misconceptions in the construct and it will keep improving
          - Express hope that this construct might help others in critically examining their own constructs
    - Part 1: Foundation
      - Chapter 1: Prior to understanding
        - Foreword
          - It wouldn't be worthwhile to write a book if there wasn't some mechanism or construct
            - which I find valuable
            - which I want to preserve through demonstration
            - which I want to share
          - This system is a mechanism that was assembled from principles (or base components)               
            - Will have its flaws
            - Might prove insightful
          - Base components
            - I would not be able to put together most basic components if I didn't start completely from scratch
            - It was only possible through thorough philosophical introspective reflection
        - Basic components
          - Introspective exposition
            - Why would we need to concern with such
              - Historic context
                - It was part of putting together the messy puzzle of misconceptions that I found myself in when I was younger and completely confused about life, my relationship with it and others
                  - Illustration
                    - Description
                      - To put things into perspective and demonstrate how misconceptions affected me personally, would worth to provide a few anecdotes from personal life. 
                    - Illustration 1: Living abroad
                      - Expectations
                        - When my family and I started living in the United States, in the beautiful state of Colorado, I thought that that was it, everything was going be downhill from here, and things will only get better and cooler from now on.
                          - My brother and I were around 20 years of age. Super young. Full of energy. Somewhat talented. Full of misconceptions that were instilled in us by the globalist society (more on that later), and I wasn't really against those misconceptions back then, they were such attractive misconceptions. My brother and I were perfect candidates for entering the meat grinder of dreams.
                          - We expected nothing less than becoming the next world sensation that everybody would talk about
                            - I know, it's very modest. But at least it's honest.
                            - However, let's be honest and admit that we all are either a covert celebrity, covert billionaire whose time hasn't come yet or in some cases a spiritual being that has transcended the worldly desires and is already partaking of the pleasures beyond this world.
                              - Of course I'm being sarcastic.
                      - Reality
                        - The reality, however, hit soon enough. 
                        - Living in an English speaking country, you realize that English that you learned in school is no English at all.
                          - You have to forget everything you learned and learn from scratch.
                          - It is extremely humiliating.
                            - When you thought you were interesting and cool
                            - All of a sudden you speak like a 1 year old that isn't particularly talented
                            - Of course the language improved gradually, but at a much slower pace than you would imagine 
                        - Without language, and even with it, it is relatively hard to make meaningful connections with people
                          - All your friends back home are now on the other side of the globe and you are on you own
                          - Because we were already too old for being high school students, yet not residents of the state to attend a college at reasonable prices
                                - Our only option was to stay home, volunteer a little bit at food pantry and to attend ESL (English as a second language) classes.
                                - Not only was this rather boring, but also not contributing to the language learning.
                                - The first year of living in the U.S. was probably the worst year in my life 
                        - All of your habits that you are used to in your country of origin are either considered weird and sometimes even illegal
                          - I remember that when my dad was teaching my brother and I to drive a car in the parking space of a mall, somebody called the police
                            - When they arrived, they stopped our car and made us step out of the car and make my dad explain the situation
                            - Of course when you don't know English very well, you are super nervous
                            - So it was a very unpleasant thing to realize that simple things, or things that we were used to back home, are now requiring extra planning and consideration.
                            - It made us second-guess almost every move.
                        - To advance to a high degree of skill, you will have to become humble
                          - Only around 5-6 years after coming to the United States and studying in the University (which was hard), we learned English well
                        - Preliminary conclusion
                          - I imagined that assimilating in another country would be difficult, but I could imagine that it would be undescribably and unimaginably difficult. Teeth-grindingly difficult. The only description that comes to mind describing what reality held -- impossibly difficult.
                            - I later saw this movie "Princess Bride," that has a very fitting line that rings true with the experience:
                              - Life is pain. Anyone who says differently is selling something.
                    - Illustration 2: Childhood dream of becoming a rock star
                      - Expectations
                        - As a dream of living easy in another country wasn't foolish enough, there was yet even more foolish dream.
                        - The dream of becoming a rock star. To be a part of the biggest rock (or pop) band.
                          - Of course I knew how to play instruments enough to be dangerous
                          - Of course I liked the material that me and my brother were putting out 
                      - Reality
                        - The reality was such that all our conceptions of music were a child play.
                          - We had material
                            - We had a couple of tunes that we didn't know how to put out into the world
                            - We played live only at open mics and not very often.
                            - We never found other band members (other than us two)
                            - Recording was so much work.
                              - The music we were recording was just demos.
                              - They were not fit for the real world audience
                          - We didn't have skills of promoting our band or even had any people that were interested in us or our cause
                            - Laziness
                              - We didn't do much to organize our band
                              - We expected that it will come naturally
                            - Introversion
                              - We were more comfortable in our own little world and fantasies than interacting with the outside world
                          - Wrong cause
                            - What we really enjoyed is the process of music creation
                            - We thought that that itself was enough, the golden goose that people will be attracted to like fruit-flies
                            - We were not performers
                              - Performance was a side goal and more theoretical
                            - What we really wanted, as it turned out, was karaoke
                              - It allowed for low stake music performance that we craved
                              - Karaoke gave us the fulfillment that we were searching in music
                              - Of course, it didn't make us rock stars, but when you on a stage singing your favorite songs, you are already living your best dream
                          - Realities of music industry
                            - Music industry is a meat grinder
                            - People in it are squeezed dry by the life-styles and the outright satanic ideology that encourages them to spin their wheels till they drop dead while infecting others to do the same
                              - But more on that later
                      - Preliminary conclusion
                        - We had a siloed and naive understanding of entering the music industry that in a sense protected us from being squeezed dry by the terrible industry without giving any return on investment.
                        - It was a learning experience, but it just showed how easy it was for us to be manipulated emotionally
                        - I believe that emotions are part of the magic sauce that gave us our talents, but they often clouded our minds and caused more pain that offering a solution. 
                    - Extra illustrations of misconceptions
                      - "Adult content is a natural thing" 18+ (find in the appendix)
              - Problem
                - The point here is simple - mess in your concepts manifests in the mess of your life
              - Solution
                - To unravel the ball of yarn of misconceptions, you sometimes have to start from scratch
                - Because you can't build a solid structure on top of a shaky foundation
      - Chapter 2: Philosophy
        - Beginnings
          - What can I be absolutely certain of?
            - Is this the real life or is it just fantasy?
              - Do I know that I exist?
                - "Cogito ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am) as a foundational belief.
                - Seemingly not useful knowledge, but it can hint at a much more fundamental shift in understanding of everything
                  - I know that I exist, but I don't know whether other things really exist
                  - Ultimately, I know nothing other than what is "shown" to me via experience.
                    - Is what is "shown" real? Or some sort of fantasy? Can I step outside the cinema?
                    - Do I know that the world exist?
                      - I can tell for sure is that what I call the world is an experience
                        - Moreover it is an experience that I believe to be true
                          - Fundamental intuition
                            - Upon examination, I can't be certain of its existence
                              - Not to the degree I can be certain of my existence
                              - Because it is dreamlike
                                - In dreams we also believe that the world is true
                                - Upon waking up, we find it strange how real to us it seemed
                            - But I have certain very strong and crude sensations and feelings/intuitions that force me to believe it is real
                              - I can't control them, but they control me
                                - Memory
                                  - Makes me believe that there is past
                                - Fantasy
                                  - Makes me believe that there is future
                                - Sensations
                                  - Pain
                                    - Hunger
                                    - ...
                              - But even if I am certain that they affect me somehow, I still can't know whether they are real or some kind of fantasy that will evaporate eventually
                    - Allows for setting the reference frame (like Copernican shift in Immanuel Kant's philosophy) from focusing on reality to our own mind, if we speak in the modern terms, or soul if we speak from the classical standpoint   
                      - This reference frame will later proof to be the most solid foundation for building the structure of understanding that we are after 
        - What is philosophy
          - This introspection is really what philosophy is about
            - Foreword
              - Funny aspect
                - Philosophers as a group don't agree on the definition
            - What is academic philosophy?
              - Community
              - System
              - Method
              - The main benefit of studying academically
                - Become acquainted with philosophical arguments of various philosophers
                  - In philosophical history not all that glitters is gold
            - What is real philosophy?
              - Intimate thing
              - Examination
                - "Unexamined life is not worth living"
                - Of mind
                  - We already mentioned the importance of the vantage point of personal existence
                    - Examining one's mind is exactly the examination required for philosophy 
                  - Discoveries in mind could either be
                    - Key to understanding anything
                    - Path to delusions
              - Like academic philosophy in personal philosophy we build
                - System
                  - If you won't build a coherent and all encompassing system over the course of your life, then your understanding will always be fragmented and kaleidoscopic
                    - Not every system will do, but only the one that is as true to experience is possible
                    - But if you are in pursuit of the true understanding
                      – You will not stop on fragmented understanding
                - Method
                  - You will develop a way to enhance and elaborate on your knowledge
                    - Building ontologies
                    - Critically examining
                    - Doubting
                    - Etc.
                - On our own
                  - True philosophers are destined to be more or less lonely as the constructs we are creating are constant subject to change and complete revision, and in academia, constructs are guarded from shattering as the maintenance of these constructs is often the purpose of the academia
              - Philosophy is always about epistemology
                - Always about the search for the truth
                  - Main problem
                    - Not easy to determine what is truth and what is just an appearance
                - Immanuel Kant went farthest than other philosophers in epistemic understanding
                  - we can only know either what is imprinted in our minds from birth (apriori)
                  - Or something from the phenomenal word that is validated by experience
                    - Knowledge only in relative terms because experience is limited in time and space and could never become absolute
                - Ethics
                  - Builds on epistemology
                    - We can only know what is good interaction or bad interaction if we know something to be true or false
                - Aesthetics
                  - We know something to be good for us or bad for us, only if we know what is true
              - Philosophy will inevitably contain contradictions
                - Immanuel Kant
                  - Demonstrated that something that stands behind the world of phenomena (phenomena maps very well to our mind, but not whatever stands behind it, and there must, as at least because we know that we are certain of apriori things are a sort of phenomenon with different modalities, which tells us that phenomena are analogous to our soul products), is something that is out of reach, and because phenomena only hint at what lies behind, they don't have the power of telling us what it really is.
                  - The limitations of the expressiveness of phenomena is the source of contradictions to the mind
                    - It makes the mind suffer as it doesn't want to stop just here, but if it isn't grounded properly, it will wander off into delusions.
              - Futility
                - Admitting that our knowledge is always limited the search for the ultimate truth might seem futile
                  - Absolute knowledge itself (apriori knowledge) is not always useful
                    - Non-applied mathematics
                    - Non-applied logic
                  - Never ending process of accumulating "relative" (not absolute) knowledge
                    - Even building understanding is a relative knowledge, as it is a process
                - Justification
                  - The process of finding the truth is really futile
                    - If believe that the ever-changing and uncertain world
                      – Is all there is
                      – There is no way out
                  - It is not futile
                    - If there is a justification for a way out
      - Chapter 3: Mind vs matter
        - Building the understanding from the ground up 
          - As we already mentioned the thing that provides has most certainty to us is the existence of our own mind
            - We also mentioned that everything else is really something that affects our mind
        - Materialism contains contradictions
          - Materialism only concerns with what is immediately perceivable
            - It does not concern itself with mind
              - It doesn't care about how is it possible for logic and other apriori universal to be possible
              - It does not care about the spiritual needs of an individual that has mind
                - Illustration: Psychiatry 
                  - Modern psychiatry only cares about fixing imbalances of chemicals in brains
                  - It does not care about providing meaning
                - It doesn't concern itself with mind and its necessities, only body and nervous system
                  - Does not satisfy individual's desire for meaning
        - Proper idealism does not contain contradictions
          - It is a solid foundation that can be built on top of
            - Even if there really was a world-in-itself, having an idealist vantage point would still be the most solid foundation for reasoning in general and a secure starting point in any discourse
              - As was clearly demonstrated by Immanuel Kant, using the reference frame of our mind is the only way we can make sense of things
                - Idealistic vantage point
          - Berkley
          - Immanuel Kant
          - Plato
          - Caution: Hegel
        - The phenomenal world (the world of phenomenons)
          - We can only know from experience
          - At its core is change because space and time are conditions of our experience
          - Our minds are also part of phenomenal world, as they reveal themselves in time and are subjects to change
          - Essentially, we as spirits (or minds or consciousness) have access to at least two "windows" through which we see things
          - We experience mind and the world somewhat differently
            - Mind
              - We have access to a wide variety of interactions and experiments can be done rather quickly
            - World
              - Our interactions are much more limited and are rather slow
          - Point about the idealist vantage point is the most crucial in this book, as in this framework, mind (or soul if using more traditional vocabulary) is key player of the world view. 
            - An answer to the core problem of what's more fundamental consciousness or matter.
              - Matter itself is not even something we can know to exist, it's an abstraction and not even a phenomenon.
              - However, we know all to well that mind exists. At least our own mind.
              - From this vantage point, believing other minds exist
                - Because there is a strong intuition that tells us that people that we perceive are similar to us, also have minds and feelings.
                - Because only thing that we know is phenomena
                  - As we already said that if reality was materialist and independent of our minds, 
                    - We would not be able to know much about it
                    - There would be no true and universal understanding of it 
                    - However, the consistency and conformity of it to our minds suggests that there exist a certain way of thinking, certain way of understanding that is correct, that is the content of mind that is true.
                      - It is also much easier to believe that reality is a product of mind 
                        - Albeit not our own and most likely not divine, as this mind is also in space and time and therefore is subject to change
                          - Let's call it the spirit of the material world
                          - It is much stronger than our minds
                            - in terms of the content and consistency it can produce
                          - It is created (because it is subject to change)
                - If everything is in essence about mind, then believing in God is the most natural thing
                  - The question now is really about understanding the true intention behind existence
                    - Because understanding is subject to change
                    - We can't know the true intention, but at least we can have a better or worse understanding
                    - To understand intentionality behind existence, we need to discuss the most important aspect about the phenomenal world
                      - Namely "change"
      - Chapter 4: Change
        - The understanding of the phenomenal world requires the concept of change at its foundation
          - Is the core contradiction and problem of the phenomenal world
            - Everything is trying to attain "completeness", but it can't
            - It is always "incompleteness" that makes things change
              - I also call incompleteness "conflict" 
                -(conflict of interests if you will, as everything is trying to become complete, but is in conflict with other things in that goal)
                - Illustration
                  - Often, take matter for example, things try to resolve this conflict in a "greedy" fashion (in computer science terms it means that it goes for the first option that is available)
        - The second part of the book will illustrate understanding of change and completeness in more detail
          - It will discuss practical applications of this understanding
            - Religion
            - Science
            - Life
          - This chapter is going to give a broader introduction to this problem 
        - Consequences of change
          - Nothing is permanent
          - Possibility of conflict 
            - Change is also the conflict resolution mechanism
            - Conflict resolution is greedy
              - No strategic "sacrifice"
                - It requires mind
              - Avoid conflict at all costs
                - Jump away
                  - Matter 
                - "Steal"
                  - Complexity
                    - Carbon molecules can get very large and unstable
        - Our minds and bodies are also subjects to the conflict of interest
          - Want to fulfill the needs, want to keep homeostasis
          - Human activities
            - Goal is to resolve some conflict
            - Examples
              - Human activities
                - Eating
                  - Give fuel for the machinery of our bodies to keep the "homeostasis", the balance, the proper function
                - Entertainment
                  - In essence is an "eating" activity, but required by our nervous system to function properly.
                  - Stories
                    - Our minds not only require information to maintain themselves in "homeostasis", 
                      - but also want this information to contain incompleteness that gets resolved
                      - Essentially they want to solve problems
                        - In essence there is a contradiction here too as we need conflict to resolve conflict
                          - This is the hallmark of the phenomenal world
                            - Contradictions are resolved in space and time
                            - All the while creating other contradictions
        - "Conflict resolution" is the answer to the "why" question 
          - Having mentioned the contradiction that we have regarding our minds
            - Our minds require "conflict" that gets resolved
            - The main embodiment of such conflict is the "why" question.
              - The real question that "why" asks is "why is it necessary".
                - Necessity of any process 
                  - Process is an interaction between entities in space and time
                    - Burning
                      - Oxigen taking away things from other atoms
                    - Thinking
                      - Mind interacts with ideas
                    - Communication
                      - Interaction between entities that understand information conveyed in a certain form (signal)
                    - Existence
                      - Interaction between presence and absence
                        - A certain apple exist
                          - I see it and identify it as something one
                          - I ate it
                          - It is no longer present as that certain something
                - Although it is hard to say whether this holds for absolutely everything in the phenomenal world
                  - But it is true for anything that I have ever observed
                  - This is definitely not a big problem, as in reality, we consider the laws of physics to be set in stone
                    - Even though they are not apriori knowledge that we can know with 100% certainty
                
    - Part 2: Building on top of the foundation
      - Chapter 5: Faith
        - Meaning of life
          - There exists no agreement on this subject
          - However, you will have to answer this question along your journey
          - The way I answer this question to the present day is as follows
          - Meaning of life is really about what is the ultimate goal of life as an activity
          - Let's imagine us having all our needs completely fulfilled. 
            - The keyword here is "completely" 
            - It is hard to imagine because there are just so many
              - Even smallest desires (needs) to breath, look at things, move parts of our body.
              - Imagine that all those needs are taken care of.
              - You would be completely stationary on the outside, as well as on the inside.
                - Because there will no longer be a need for anything
          - Any action/activity is there because we are incomplete
          - Life as an activity has only one goal - completion
            - Physical homeostasis, trying to get things into balance, non-stop
            - Our psychological needs of belonging
              - Having lived a life that is valued by us as part of a greater context (society)
            - Can't achieve it 
              - Personal death
              - Death of civilizations
              - Death of information carriers
          - Meaning of life is the achievement of completeness
            - But it is an impossible goal
            - If we are to achieve it in the phenomenal world
            - Meaning of life requires looking outside the phenomenal world
        - Happiness
          - Completeness
            - Faith is one of our foundational needs
            - However, even if we acknowledge the need for faith, we need to be extra careful not to count our faith as a story that we tell ourselves
              - The most important point is that we are after the truth
              - Not a make believe
              - If we are deceiving ourselves, we are fools
              - Our faith has to be bought for a high price of doubt and hard work
        - Religion
          - Acknowledging that we need faith, we need to search for what is already known and whether there are patterns
            - What paths have others went through 
          - Patterns behind many religions
            - Completeness lies outside this world
            - The other world doesn't have the same problems that we do here
              - Majority of religions
                - Other world is similar to this one (changing, not complete)
              - Few religions
                - Escape is complete and fulfilling
                  - Christianity
                  - Buddhism
            - Requirements to escape exist 
            - I take seriously only the religions that have a promise of the ultimate escape, the ultimate completeness
              - Otherwise even heaven will be temporary bliss before deities destroy each other
              - Completeness is the core contradiction of our minds and our world, if we have longing for something that is impossible to achieve, then our existence is a complete joke. A very very bad joke.
                - But jumping to this conclusion would be too rushed
                - This place of desolation will always be there as the last resort, so why not start looking at what are some other options
                - As a side note, those who jump to the conclusion of this existence being a bad joke (myself in the past included) are really just looking for excuses to get high and have a break from the difficulties of the existence. It is laziness, cowardice and egoism all in one. 
          - Why Christianity?
            - Foreword
              - I have to be very careful describing my understanding, as it is known that in the domain of religion misconceptions are especially dangerous and can lead people into uncontrollable musings that end up being either complete madness or affecting the reputation of faith as such
            - Christianity is unique
              - A person, namely each one of us, not civilization or some cosmic accident that causes our existence, is in the center
                - Buddhism is similar in this regard, but it is an impersonal and non-religious prescriptive algorithm
                  - Removing everything from the person's search for diving except the practice
                  - Person without God is a direct path to ego blowing up
              - God not only cares about people, He is willing to sacrifice Himself for them
                - If compared to Hephestus or Mitra or some other sacrifice, then it's because they have a common enemy that they disagree with
                  - In case of Christianity, our fall was necessary and its core is a mystery, for God is beyond the phenomenal world.
                    - But part of this mystery included reestablishment of the relationship between people (us) who falsely believed that they can be like Gods, through faith and especially understanding that faith is the most important virtue and thing that we really need
              - Suffering has meaning
                - Suffering as somet
              - Salvation is not a luxury, it is ours to take
                - Spiritual content, more precisely faith, not physical well being, matters
                - Politics is not important
                  - Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation.
                - Money is not important
                - There is no algorithm, God is the only one who can figure things out, we just need to trust Him and His plan
                  - It's not a point collection game
                    - Reward is not based on how many points you collected
                      - Pharisees
                      - Islam
                    - Reward is based on how strong faith is
                      - It is not beneficial to think of faith as any other skill that you can build
                        - If you start approaching similar as with points, you will soon fall in contradictions
                          - You will start compete for these points
                            - Uncovers bad motivation
                            - some sort of possession and self-fulfillment
                          - You will compare yourself to others
                            - You will think that you are better than others based on how much points you have
                      - It is also not laziness, where you just lazily say that only God can figure something out and so on
                      - It is something about personal, something only between you and God that will be tested throughout life as you face difficult situations that tell you about who you really are and where you stand with God
                        - If you don't learn through all your life that you are a very modest creature at best, then you don't learn anything.
                        - And only through God that you find hope for the resolution of this predicament.
                        - Knowing that you are most likely fail yourself and others when faced with a tough situation, you really start to pray hard with all your heart when faced with such a situation.
                        - Even though I am pretty sure that my faith is not very strong, I still don't panic, as I know that God knows our heart, and if we are willing to work on ourselves will give us as many chances as we need (and even more) to improve the situation
                          - Essentially, what keeps me going is that I know that God is there for me and will always be there for me
                            - He is the kindest and most loving beyond imagination
                            - Unlike some kind people that are kind because it helps them to avoid conflict and feel better about their otherwise weaknesses, He is ultimately strong spirited and is courageous beyond imagination
                              - So His love isn't just given to be thrown away, you will have to fight for it and you will be rewarded (always)  
              - We are given all the freedom in the world
                - God doesn't punish us for our choices
                  - We either punishing ourselves
                  - Or being given correctness feedback
                  - Suffering in this world are either:
                    - Consequence of the existence of evil in the phenomenal contradictory world
                      - Even then this evil when taken with faith can help us to grow our faith even more
                    - Self-inflicted 
              - Dialectics (contradictions)
                - One of the things that blow my mind about Christianity are "beautifully crafted" the dialectical contradictions
                  - Of course I don't believe that they are part of the human thought, as such sophistication seems impossible for people in the context of those times
                  - The most natural thing to expect from Divine entering our world is that there will be contradictions irreconcilable by our mind
                    - I call these "dialecticisms"
                      - Birth of God in flesh
                        - Virgin giving birth
                        - King is born in the manger
                      - "Most righteous" pharisees and terrible toll workers
                      - It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle
                      - For people to have eternal life an ultimate sin must be committed
                      - Repented thief is first to enter the Kingdom of Heaven
                      - Metaphors (not complicated stories) are best for understanding of what lies beyond   
            - Christianity is way too deep to not take it seriously
          - Two serious contenders for me in the search for divine are
            - Christianity
            - Buddhism
            - How to choose one or the other?
              - I believe that eightfold path is not contradicting a healthy Christian practice
              - However, I believe that being just a Buddhist contradicts Christianity
              - Using an argument similar to the Pascal's wager, it seems that you can have a healthy compromise
              - If we are really about searching the truth and not just looking for something that is either popular or fits our personality, then we always will be wrong
                - At the end of the day you have to pay a high price for truth and searching for it
                - You have to make many mistakes
                - Shed many tears
                - Feel very lonely and misunderstood
                - If your faith isn't purchased through suffering, it is worth nothing
                  - Atheism or agnosticism cannot be considered with seriousness because they are "not bought", they are just accepted as status quo.
                  - Some religions are chosen because they fit our personality
                  - Non of this can be regarded with any seriousness if our goal is to figure things out  
          - What is the modern globalist religion?
            - Childhood dreams
              - Ideal means of manipulation
            - Nihilism
              - Ideal for manipulating of consciousness to believe anything
