## The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Part 1, Chapter 1: Prior to Understanding

This chapter explores the necessity of constructing a fundamental understanding of the world from scratch, a process I underwent through deep philosophical introspection. While the resulting framework is imperfect, it serves as a valuable tool for clarity and reflection.

### The Need for Understanding

Before detailing how I developed my perspective, it is essential to address why this effort was necessary. My early life was marked by confusion about myself, others, and the broader meaning of life. These uncertainties stemmed from a chaotic blend of misconceptions that demanded unraveling.

When my family and I moved to the United States, I believed the move signaled an exciting, upward trajectory. At twenty years old, my brother and I were full of energy and ambition but also burdened with naive dreams fueled by the seductive ideals of a globalized society.

We envisioned ourselves as destined for greatness, imagining fame and success as natural outcomes. But reality swiftly intervened. Living in an English-speaking country revealed the inadequacies of our language skills. The English we had learned in school proved useless, and starting over was humbling. Communicating like toddlers—with broken grammar and limited vocabulary—shattered any illusions of sophistication.

The cultural transition extended beyond language. Simple habits from home were suddenly complicated. For example, my father’s attempt to teach us driving in a mall parking lot resulted in a police encounter, highlighting how even mundane actions required caution and adaptation.

The first year in the U.S. was among the most challenging of my life. The alienation, compounded by limited social connections and financial constraints, forced my brother and me into a cycle of introspection and self-doubt. Over time, perseverance led to incremental progress. It took five to six years of effort, including university studies, to achieve fluency and begin feeling at home.

From this experience, I learned a harsh but vital truth: life’s challenges are often more difficult than anticipated. As the movie *The Princess Bride* aptly states, “Life is pain. Anyone who says differently is selling something.”

As if the challenges of immigration weren’t enough, we also harbored a dream of becoming rock stars. We believed our passion for music would naturally lead to success. While we possessed talent and ambition, our understanding of the music industry was naïve and romanticized.

We wrote songs and performed occasionally, but we lacked the discipline, connections, and knowledge necessary for success. Recording sessions felt like chores, and promotion was non-existent. Introversion kept us isolated in our creative bubble, where we believed the quality of our work alone would attract attention.

In hindsight, I am grateful we didn’t enter the industry. Its exploitative nature and hedonistic culture would have been destructive. Instead, our failed musical aspirations taught us the dangers of emotional idealism and the value of humility.

### The Mess in Your Concepts, the Mess in Your Life

These experiences underscore a critical point: misconceptions lead to disorder in life. To create a coherent and stable understanding, one must be willing to deconstruct flawed ideas and rebuild from the ground up. This process is neither easy nor quick, but it is essential for meaningful growth.

In the next chapter, I will delve into the process of unraveling misconceptions and constructing a framework for understanding.
