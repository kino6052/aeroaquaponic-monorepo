I would like to begin this book by explaining its purpose.

Firstly, I intend it to serve as a snapshot of my thoughts and understanding at the time. Not just any thoughts but the ones that I consider especially valuable. Thoughts that accumulated into what I believe is a coherent worldview that is somewhat unique and quite different from what some are used to.

Secondly, I would like to demonstrate that an understanding of the world is a personal construct that we build throughout our lives. This is important to understand because we often take this construct for granted without questioning it. I hope that by achieving this goal, I could stimulate the reader toward a more thorough examination of this construct.

Thirdly, I want to demonstrate that a well-formed understanding allows for a happier life. I hope this demonstration could inspire the inner process of reexamination and reformation.

Number four, I intend it to serve as an example of the actual process of getting a well-formed understanding of the world. This will not be just purely theoretical, but as practical as possible. I concur with the philosophers who always sought the grounding of philosophy in experience.

Lastly, by writing this book I want to outline the path forward, probably most notably for myself, and to encourage the reader to follow their own journey. Yes, this book is somewhat selfish, in the sense that I intend it as a retrospective analysis of my life so far so I could better orient myself to continue my journey.

The personal understanding that I want to share here will be broken into a variety of insightful topics.

In part one, I will establish some theoretical background that will set the stage for more practical topics. Here, I will demonstrate that by starting with a few small but important axioms, we achieve relatively simple conclusions. However, these conclusions, and I will attempt to demonstrate this, will have a tremendous impact on the entire worldview.

In part two, I will discuss more practical subject matter.

Despite it being something very personal, I will discuss faith. I will share with you my beliefs and will explain why I have these convictions.

I will then discuss science topics such as math, physics, biology, and, very near and dear to me, computer science. These are exciting topics that I’m personally looking forward to discussing.

To wrap things up, we will conclude with a discussion of the lifestyle that has formed from this understanding.

I hope I was able to provide a brief overview and provide motivation to embark on this journey with me.

So, without further ado, let’s get started!
