## The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Introduction

This book begins with a clear purpose: to share and reflect on my understanding of the world at this moment in time. My aim is to present thoughts that I believe are both valuable and coherent, forming a worldview that may be unique and unconventional.

The first purpose of this book is to offer a snapshot of these thoughts, inviting readers to explore ideas that challenge the constructs we often take for granted. Understanding the world is a deeply personal journey, one that evolves over a lifetime. By examining this process, I hope to inspire readers to critically analyze and refine their own perspectives.

Secondly, I wish to demonstrate that a well-formed understanding of the world can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life. This book is not purely theoretical; it aims to provide practical insights grounded in experience. Philosophy, after all, gains its power from its connection to real life.

Another purpose of this book is to serve as an example of how one can construct a meaningful worldview. By sharing my journey, I hope to illustrate the steps toward gaining clarity and coherence in understanding the complexities of life. In doing so, I also aim to outline a path forward—both for myself and for those who might find these reflections valuable.

This personal journey will be divided into distinct parts, each offering its own insights:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: The first section will establish a foundation for understanding. By starting with a few small but significant axioms, I will show how simple premises can lead to profound conclusions that shape an entire worldview.

2. **Practical Applications**: The second section delves into practical subjects, including faith, science, and lifestyle. Faith, while deeply personal, is integral to my understanding, and I will share my beliefs and the reasoning behind them. In science, I will explore topics such as mathematics, physics, biology, and computer science—areas that have significantly influenced my thinking. Finally, I will discuss how these understandings have shaped my approach to life.

Through these chapters, my goal is to weave a narrative that is both deeply personal and universally resonant. While this book serves as a retrospective analysis of my own journey, it is also an invitation for readers to embark on their own path of discovery and growth.

I hope this introduction provides a glimpse into the themes and motivations of this work. Let us begin this journey of exploration and understanding together.
