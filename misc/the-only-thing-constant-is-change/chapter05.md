## The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Part 2: Chapter 5: Faith

If the "why" question is the most essential to ask, then the meaning of life becomes its most fundamental form. Though there’s no universal consensus, I must confront it and provide my own answer.

At its core, this question could be reframed as: *What is the ultimate goal of life as an activity?*

To explore this, I imagine a state where all my needs and desires are entirely fulfilled. The emphasis here is on the word "completely." This thought experiment is challenging because needs and desires are so numerous and deeply ingrained. In this hypothetical state, I wouldn’t need to breathe, see, or move. I would be utterly still, both externally and internally. Why act if there is no need?

Every action stems from a drive to fulfill some need or desire, which arise because I, as part of the phenomenal world, am inherently incomplete.

Life, as an activity, pursues a singular goal: **completion.** Living beings are unique among material entities because they strive to maintain their systemic integrity. Unlike inert matter, they carry the information that defines their form—not just physical shape, but behavior, purpose, and essence—and mechanisms to sustain this form. This homeostasis operates on multiple levels, from individual cells to entire societies, all seeking fulfillment of their needs and desires.

However, because awareness of my needs emerges through subjective experience, my desires often misinterpret those needs. I frequently crave things I don’t genuinely require. This theme ties back to the first chapter, where I identified confusion and incoherence in understanding the world as sources of dissatisfaction and grief, including the misinterpretation of needs.

But even if needs were clear, achieving fulfillment remains impossible because of death. Death—both personal and communal—renders the pursuit of completeness futile. Every living being eventually succumbs, as do populations, species, and ecosystems. The phenomenal world’s central conflict—incompleteness—ensures perpetual struggle, with no resolution in sight.

This contradiction feels cruel, like a cosmic joke—a Sisyphean existence where the goal remains forever out of reach.

Naturally, this raises a profound question: *Is there a way out of this strange, futile dream?* And if so, *what is this dream about?*

For much of my life, I believed death offered an escape—a final dissolution into non-existence. It seemed unavoidable, a last resort that allowed life to continue without despair. This belief fostered a passive attitude, excusing laziness, cowardice, and self-indulgence. However, shifting my perspective changed everything. Viewing existence as a "dream" reframed death not as cessation, but as transition: *"To sleep; perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub: for in that sleep of death what dreams may come?"* Shakespeare’s words now resonate deeply. Death, far from being an escape, demands serious consideration and preparation.

So, what options remain? How can I escape this dream where death looms over every endeavor, rendering them ultimately futile?

Humanity has long sought answers to this question, giving rise to countless religious and philosophical traditions. Some myths—like those of the Greeks, Romans, and Norse—depict gods as powerful yet incomplete beings, akin to humans but grander. Others, however, propose paths to transcendence. Among these, Christianity and Buddhism stand out as profound attempts to escape the phenomenal world entirely.

I approach this topic with caution, recognizing the dangers of misunderstanding religion. Misconceptions can lead to madness or discredit faith itself—outcomes I strive to avoid.

While I lack deep understanding of Buddhism, my exposure has been through Western interpretations influenced by figures like Alan Watts, often framing it as a counterpoint to Christianity. This "Western Buddhism" diverges from its authentic roots, serving more as a cultural critique than a spiritual practice. Despite this, my limited study suggests Buddhism focuses on *how* to escape, presenting a practical algorithm rather than addressing *why* escape is necessary.

Christianity, however, offers a uniquely profound perspective. It centers humanity within the cosmos, portraying the universe as a stage for free will—a gift so powerful it became the source of human misery. According to Christianity, the fundamental conflict of the phenomenal world lies in the problem of good and evil. When humanity first turned away from God, the world’s nature and human will were corrupted. Mortality and suffering became inherent conditions of existence.

Though God’s intentions transcend human understanding, Christianity teaches that the resolution of these issues lies with Him, not with us. Our role is to trust, turn toward God, and accept His help—not on our terms, but on His.

In this narrative, God’s love is sacrificial and transformative. By becoming incarnate as Jesus Christ, He shared in human suffering, demonstrating how free will must be exercised. Christ’s crucifixion—one of history’s most excruciating torments—was both a profound act of solidarity and the key to humanity’s redemption.

Christianity is replete with dialectical contradictions—paradoxes that defy logic but reveal deeper truths:

- God is born in the flesh.
- A virgin gives birth.
- The King of Kings is born in a manger.
- The "most righteous" Pharisees are worse than tax collectors.
- A camel passes through the eye of a needle.
- A repentant thief enters heaven first.
- Simple metaphors convey truths beyond comprehension.

The ultimate paradox is that God was killed by His chosen people. This unimaginable event underscores the depth of human sin and the boundlessness of divine forgiveness. Christianity asserts that even in our worst failures, hope endures through God’s grace.

Unlike other traditions, Christianity places ultimate significance outside the phenomenal world. Politics and wealth are irrelevant: *"Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation."* Faith isn’t a point-collection system or a skill to be mastered. It’s deeply personal—a relationship with God tested through life’s challenges. True faith requires humility, recognizing our limitations and relying on God’s strength.

Through faith, suffering gains meaning as part of the process of escaping the phenomenal world. Though the path is arduous, it becomes possible with God’s help. His love is unfathomable yet steadfast, demanding effort but offering infinite reward.

In Christianity, I find a compelling answer to life’s ultimate question. It addresses the conflict of the phenomenal world with unparalleled depth and clarity, offering hope and purpose amid life’s contradictions.

With this understanding, I am ready to continue examining the phenomenal world and deepen my quest for truth.
