## The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Part 2: Chapter 7: Living in the Ever-Changing World

In this chapter, I will synthesize the conclusions drawn from earlier discussions and explore how these ideas apply to personal life and well-being.

The central message of this book is that the phenomenal world contains an inherent contradiction: the inability to attain the completeness that all material things seek. Recognizing this, I should not aim to establish an unshakable foundation within the physical world. Instead, my focus must shift to strengthening the foundation of my spirit and mind. By cultivating understanding and nurturing faith, I can begin to disconnect my heart from the transient nature of the phenomenal world and direct it toward seeking an escape from its confines.

One natural consequence of this perspective is an inclination toward humility and minimalism. Possessions tether us to the phenomenal world and obscure the reality that it is impermanent and, inevitably, will fail to fulfill us.

Some individuals take this principle further, choosing paths of monasticism or asceticism in their pursuit of detachment and spiritual clarity. While admirable, these paths are not for everyone; they demand a profound calling and commitment. For now, I do not see myself embracing such extremes. Instead, I remain open to exploration while focusing on understanding and refining my approach to life.

Currently, I am experimenting with a concept I call the *unit of self-sufficiency*. This framework represents an attempt to define a minimal but complete system that fulfills basic, psychological, and self-actualization needs for the smallest number of people using sustainable resources.

A unit of self-sufficiency envisions a community where individuals live off the land and cultivate diverse skills to address their challenges. While idealistic, this model requires practical grounding to uncover its possibilities and limitations. To this end, I am developing a proof of concept to better understand how such a lifestyle might work in reality.

Having grown up in an urban environment, I lack many of the skills necessary for self-sufficient living. Thus, my family and I are gradually transitioning toward this way of life, learning through trial and error. This journey is fraught with difficulties and mistakes, but it feels essential for deepening my understanding of the phenomenal world, myself, and my relationships with others.

This book not only fulfills its initial objectives but also lays the groundwork for a curriculum that could serve as a blueprint for creating a unit of self-sufficiency. I aim to systematically outline the knowledge required for such an endeavor and propose hands-on projects that progressively build the skills needed for success.

Moreover, I hope to pass on this knowledge to others. The act of teaching and mentoring developing minds will not only refine my understanding but also ensure that these insights are shared and expanded upon by future generations.

In closing, I am reminded of the parallels between life and software development. Just as software requires testing, implementation, and continuous refactoring to remain effective and adaptable, so too must I approach my understanding of the world. Inquiry provides data, application deepens insight, and simplification clarifies the truth.

The only thing constant in the phenomenal world is change. This core contradiction is the root of all existence within it. The phenomenal world will never grant us lasting fulfillment.

We must seek to escape this strange dream. We need God.
