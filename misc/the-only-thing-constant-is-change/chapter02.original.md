## The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Part 1: Chapter 2: Philosophy

So, if I find myself tangled in this messy yarn that has accumulated throughout my life, a good place to start figuring the way out would be to ask myself: “Is this the real life or is it just fantasy?”.

Now, this passage comes from a song and I did mean it jokingly. My version is a paraphrased version of that: “What can I be absolutely sure of?”

The reason this inquiry is a good idea is because I attempt to get back to the foundation of the structure that I call understanding. It requires courage, as it is easy to dismiss it as a road to insanity and confusion, which is true in some sense, but this road of inquiry is unavoidable, and, sooner or later, I will have to tread it.

I’m not going to defend this point of view, I’m just going to outline my personal discoveries along this path.

When the question of absolute certainty, of absolute reality, is posed, it becomes evident that it is not easy to answer. How do I know something exists? I sure can feel things around me with a variety of senses. But the problem is that I can do so when I sleep too, and after I wake up I am surprised how convinced I was that the reality in my sleep was real.

By distinguishing reality from dreams, I can then distinguish myself that experiences them because, in both of them, something remains similar, namely me.

So knowing that there are experiences and there is “I”, I can ask myself, how do I know that I exist? Attempting to answer it, I can ask myself whether it is even possible to doubt it, because if I doubt it, there it is still I who doubts, I can’t get rid of somebody who doubts when doubting everything. My analytical mind dictates to me what it’s certain about and what it isn’t. My heart, my psychology, on the other hand, still might say that it doesn’t care what the mind says, it just doesn’t want to trust anything. If I were to follow my heart with this advice, I would fall into the trap of ultimate skepticism, the most irrational and useless type of philosophizing.

So far, the knowledge of personal existence seems to be a piece of real knowledge, that is, it has the certainty that my mind desires. Now how about the experience part? Do I know that the world exists?

Ultimately, I know nothing about the world apart from what is presented to me by my experience. I am aware that inside me lies a strong conviction that this world exists, but this conviction doesn’t have the same certainty that the existence of self has.

The reality of dreams and waking life seem very similar. Both realities have limitations as to what we can control. Even if I can control parts of this world via certain interactions using physical interactions in reality or lucid dreams in my sleep (of which I had a few instances), for the most part, these realities are still not something I can fully control, rather they control me.

Moreover, upon further examination, I understand that there are other faculties of my mind that make me distinguish between what’s real and what is not.

My memory tells me a story of what had been and convinces me that there is a past.

My imagination tells me of what could happen and even experience these situations. In fact, imagination is like reality itself, but the one I can control at will, yet it is much weaker in content and sensation when compared to the experience that presents to the mind as reality.

Senses tell me of pain, fear, hunger, as well as other things that present to mind so strongly compared to everything else. In fact, senses do force me to believe reality is real because my soul wants to avoid the experience of fear and pain at all costs.

But this conviction is still not telling me how to distinguish between dreams and reality. Even if one kind of experience seems more real, it still doesn’t present to me with guarantees it won’t evaporate eventually like a dream.

So if I can’t determine whether experiences are real or not, can I somehow step out of this strange cinema? That I don’t know. But even if it was possible, wouldn’t it be just a form of changing of cinema? “I” and experiences are essential components of what I call reality, take one away and the other won’t make sense.

What does this understanding of reality give me? It gives me a way of setting a reference frame. Previously, I might have thought that the world that I experience is the ultimate reality, but through this simple introspection, I am now not so sure about that, and it seems more valid to change the reference frame and to declare that the only substance, the only thing that my mind gives me as an absolute certainty is the existence of itself.

What conclusions could be drawn from this understanding of the world? This will be discussed in the next chapter.

In this chapter, I want to emphasize that this type of introspection is exactly what true philosophy is about.

However, to begin the discussion of how philosophy might be helpful for my purposes, I need to make a remark and note that it is quite funny that philosophers as a group don’t even agree on what philosophy is, let alone any other truth they discover. But I let it not be a deterrent in my pursuit, as my experience of learning about philosophy has taught me a few things.

First of all, I recognize that academic philosophy is threefold. It consists of community, system, and method. It is essentially like a sport, or a board game, or any collective activity for that matter. Where people know the rules and operate within their reach. Over time, it becomes a tradition, like soccer or basketball, where breaking changes are not welcome, as the system is sufficiently happy on its own.

As part of this communal activity, there is a method that allows us to adapt it to the realities of the world, but this method is more analytical and is only about clarifications rather than the discovery of fundamental knowledge. For example, in mathematics, Euclidean geometry is completely self-sufficient, and all other geometries are not necessarily additions but separate “branches” of it that don’t modify the original geometry.

In philosophy, the method usually manifests itself in guidelines that dictate the form of an argument.

For example, when we find ourselves in the system of Marxism, everything revolves around class struggle. So additions to it will always turn a given phenomenon into something related to class struggle.

In the Hegelian system, everything revolves around the dialectical process. Additions to it will always turn a given phenomenon into something related to the dialectical process.

In the Kantian system, everything revolves around the distinction between apriori and aposteriori. Additions to it will always turn a given phenomenon into something related to this distinction.

The problem with academic philosophy is that academicians don’t necessarily look after the truth, but rather they just maintain this system, this understanding.

When I set out to understand the foundation, I want to be certain that the real state of affairs is one way and not the other, in other words, I’m after the Truth itself. I don’t care about how great one or the other system is in terms of its consistency and community.

In this sense, I don’t care for academic philosophy. But I have to admit that academic philosophy is still useful. Academic philosophy allows for comparative analysis. It lets us become acquainted with the philosophical arguments of various philosophers and, through this, it encourages our own thinking. However, academic philosophy once fooled me into thinking that philosophy is progressive in nature and that what is closer to us reflects a truer understanding compared to various arguments of the past. This is a baseless judgment, as philosophers in the past had a much clearer and deeper introspective grasp that any modern man can hope for.

Even though academic philosophy is useful, its usefulness is obstructed by the fact that it often reads like ciphertext, like something incomprehensible. Why then something that deals with the most simple, the most basic things, in the true sense of the word, becomes so convoluted and difficult to interpret? I believe this is best understood from the software development standpoint. Programming is a quite straightforward activity. We build constructs similar to how philosophers build them, but machines help us verify their correctness. Similar to philosophers, we rely on certain conventions and best practices and a lot of context that lies behind a given task. This metadata is rarely captured and for a person not familiar with this context, it would be difficult to put the puzzle together. I believe the same goes for philosophy. Philosophers’ works were affected by contexts quite different from ours, so the words they chose often did not convey direct meaning but rather acted as allusions.

Unlike academic philosophy, true philosophy is much more personal. It is all about examination. It is an examination of the mind. There is a famous saying by Socrates: “The life which is unexamined is not worth living”. This quote comes from a renowned dialogue “Apology”, where Socrates explains why he couldn’t stop philosophizing and discuss virtue, even though it turned people against him. The dialogues of Plato demonstrate clearly that such examination is a source of valuable insights and, even though almost every examination ends in aporia or contradiction, it still helps build a better understanding. Discoveries that are made in this process can either become key to understanding things on a deep level, or a path to delusions.

Like in academic philosophy, when I philosophize, I’m building a system. If I don’t build a coherent and all-encompassing system over the course of my life, then understanding will always remain fragmented and kaleidoscopic. Of course, building a system for the system’s sake is a bad idea, but if you ground it as much in experience as possible, then over time it should allow for a truer understanding. And, since I am in pursuit of true understanding, I will not stop at fragmented understanding.

Like in academic philosophy, over time a method is developed. A method that helps enhance and elaborate on the knowledge. For example, using tools like ontology trees. Critical examination by presenting your ideas to the court of the mind. Naturally, doubting everything. Drawing analogies. Finding generalized forms and algorithms. There will be more examples in the later chapters.

However, unlike academic philosophy, true philosophers are destined to be more or less lonely in their pursuit of understanding. One of the reasons for this is that the understanding we are creating is subject to change and sometimes for complete revision, while in academia, constructs are guarded from changes, as the protection of these constructs is often the sole purpose of the academia.

True philosophy is always about distinguishing truth from appearances. This makes true philosophy epistemology, or the study of knowledge itself. Even if we want to understand ethics — how we ought to interact with others — or aesthetics — how we ought to determine what is good for us, it is still about the same criterion — what is true and what is appearance. For example, if treating others badly might give us short-term rewards, by being unjust to others I will eventually cause harm to myself. Or if I like eating junk food because it makes me feel good, over time it will cause serious damage to my health. The point here is to determine what is an appearance — short-term pleasure, and the truth — real consequences.

I believe that, among academic philosophers, Immanuel Kant went farthest in epistemic understanding. According to his understanding, we can only know either what is imprinted in our minds from birth (apriori) or something from the world that we experience (phenomenal), but the knowledge that we receive from the world is only relative as our experience is limited in time and space and could never become absolute as apriori understanding.

Immanuel Kant’s critical philosophy is a gem because it helps us to examine the boundaries of our understanding. A true philosopher who is after the Truth should be able to admit that their understanding will always have limitations, that they themselves have limitations. Because our understanding is limited, the true understanding will always be out of reach, there will always be discrepancies between it and reality. No amount of phenomena would be able to generalize sufficiently to become the absolute and true understanding similar to apriori because any finite amount always begs the question of “what’s next?”.

Therefore it might seem futile to begin this journey after the Truth itself. The only absolute knowledge that we may have, that of non-applied mathematics and logic, may seem not very useful. However, as we all know even relative knowledge proves to be a source of endless benefits, and the more fundamental it is in nature, the greater the benefits.

Now, for me to continue building my understanding, I have to face the most fundamental decision. That is decide on the reference frame. Do I continue using the “outside” world, the world of experiences, as my reference frame or do I stick with the new reference frame of the mind?
