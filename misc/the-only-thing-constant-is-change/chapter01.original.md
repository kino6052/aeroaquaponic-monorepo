## The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Part 1: Chapter 1: Prior to Understanding

In part one of the book, I will share my experience of building a fundamental understanding from scratch, which was only possible through deep philosophical introspection. This system, assembled from principles, has its flaws, but it may still prove insightful.

Before explaining how I arrived at my understanding, I first need to explain why it was necessary. It was part of putting together the messy puzzle of misconceptions that I found myself in when I was younger. I was confused about life, myself, and others.

Illustration 1: Living abroad
When my family and I moved to the United States, I thought that that was it, everything was going to be downhill from there, and things would only get better and cooler from now on.

My brother and I were around 20 years old. Super young. Full of energy. Had our talents. And surely full of misconceptions instilled in us by the globalist society (more on that later), and I wasn’t really against those misconceptions back then, as they were such attractive misconceptions. My brother and I were perfect candidates for entering the meat grinder of dreams, which is what America is.

We expected nothing less than to become the next world sensation that everybody would talk about. (I know, it’s very modest. But at least it’s honest.)

However, let’s be honest and admit that we all are either a covert celebrity, a covert billionaire whose time hasn’t come just yet, or, in some cases, a spiritual being that has transcended worldly desires and is already partaking of the pleasures beyond this world. (Of course, I’m being sarcastic).

Yet, the reality hit soon enough.

Living in an English-speaking country, you realize that the English that you learned in school is no English at all. You have to forget everything you learned and learn from scratch. Which is extremely humiliating. Just when you thought you were interesting and cool, all of a sudden you speak like a 1-year-old, and not a particularly talented one. Of course, the language improved gradually, but at a much slower pace than you would expect.

Without the language, and even with it, it is relatively hard to make meaningful connections with people. All your friends back home are now on the other side of the globe and you are on your own.

Because my brother and I were already too old to be high school students and not yet residents of the state to attend a college at reasonable prices, our only option was to stay home, volunteer a little bit at a food pantry, and attend ESL (English as a second language) classes. Not only was this rather boring, but it also did not contribute to the language learning.

This might sound dramatic, but the first year of living in the U.S. was one of the worst years of my life. All of the habits that you established in your country of origin are either considered weird or sometimes even illegal. I remember that when my dad was teaching my brother and me to drive a car in the parking space of a mall, somebody called the police. When the police arrived, they stopped our car, asked us to step out of it, and explained the situation. Of course, when you don’t know English very well, you are super nervous

So it was a very unpleasant thing to realize that simple things, or things that we were used to back home, are now requiring extra planning and consideration. It made us second-guess almost every move.

To advance to a high degree of skill, you will have to become humble. Only around 5–6 years after coming to the United States and studying at the University (which was hard), we learned English well.

To provide a preliminary conclusion about misconceptions. I imagined that assimilating into another country would be difficult, but I could not imagine that it would be undescribably and unimaginably difficult. Teeth-grindingly difficult. I later saw the movie “Princess Bride,” which had a very fitting line that rings true to the experience: “Life is pain. Anyone who says differently is selling something.”

Illustration 2: Childhood dreams
As if thinking that living was easy for immigrants in the U.S. wasn’t foolish enough, there was yet an even more foolish dream.

We wanted to become rock stars. To be a part of the biggest rock (or pop) band.

It wasn’t completely baseless. Of course, we knew how to play instruments enough to be dangerous. Of course, we liked the material that we were putting out.

However, the reality was such that all our conceptions of music were childish. Yes, we had our songs. But we played live only at open mics and even then not very often. We never found other band members (other than us two). Recording was so much work and we never looked forward to it, so the music we were recording was just demos not fit for the real-world audience. We didn’t have the skills to promote our band or even have any people who were interested in us or our cause.

We didn’t do much to organize our band. We expected that it would come naturally. Partly due to introversion. We were more comfortable in our own little world of fantasies than interacting with the outside world.

I wasn’t a performer. Performance was a side goal and more theoretical. What I really enjoyed was the process of creating music. I thought that that itself was enough, the golden goose that people will be attracted to like fruitflies

Looking back, I realize that even though we didn’t make it to the music industry, I am extremely grateful for that. The music industry is a meat grinder. People in it are squeezed dry by the lifestyles and the outright satanic ideology that encourages them to spin their wheels till they drop dead while infecting others to do the same. But more on that later.

To draw a preliminary conclusion. We had a siloed and naive understanding of what it means to do music professionally. However, it was a learning experience, but it just showed how easy it was for us to be manipulated emotionally. I believe that emotions are part of the magic sauce that gave us our talents, but they often cloud our minds and cause more pain than offering a solution.

The point here is simple — the mess in your concepts manifests in the mess in your life.

The mess in your concepts manifests in the mess in your life. To unravel misconceptions, you sometimes have to start from scratch, as you can’t build a solid structure on a shaky foundation.

In the next chapter, I will begin demonstrating a process of unraveling.
