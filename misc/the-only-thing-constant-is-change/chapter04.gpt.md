## The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Part 1, Chapter 4: Change

Having established my reference frame, I can now examine the world of phenomena and experiences in greater depth.

### Space, Time, and Change

The most fundamental observation about the world, as philosophers like Immanuel Kant and George Berkeley agree, is that it exists within time and space. According to their views, time and space are inseparable from our experience and even serve as conditions for it. In simpler terms, we cannot perceive anything outside these dimensions.

But how do I become aware of time and space? It is through change. For instance, when an apple falls from a tree, I observe its spatial movement over time. I connect the apple on the ground with the apple I recall in my memory—a single entity in two different instances of space and time. This suggests that change is even more fundamental than space and time, as my awareness of them depends on observing change.

### Critiquing Hegel’s Perspective on Change

Georg Hegel is a prominent figure in philosophy who placed change at the center of his system. While change is integral to my framework, I refrain from fully embracing Hegel’s ideas, as they exemplify problematic philosophical tendencies.

First, Hegel dismissed Immanuel Kant’s critical philosophy, which established safeguards against speculative metaphysics. Kant’s emphasis on the limits of human knowledge and the distinction between phenomena (what we can perceive) and noumena (what lies beyond perception) prevents ungrounded theorizing. Hegel, however, uses his dialectical method to construct a grand narrative of the world’s inevitable progression toward an absolute spirit or utopia. Such speculative claims lack verification and stray into fantasy.

Second, Hegel overlooks the distinction between the phenomenal world and a priori knowledge, such as mathematics and logic. While change characterizes the phenomenal world of experiences, it does not apply to the immutable truths of mathematics and logic. Conflating these realms undermines clarity and precision in his framework.

Finally, Hegel’s writing is notoriously dense and inaccessible. Philosophy demands clarity, yet his convoluted prose alienates readers and obscures understanding.

While I do not seek to thoroughly critique Hegel, I aim to adapt his notion of change thoughtfully. By grounding it in empirical observation and avoiding speculative excess, I ensure my framework remains clear, accessible, and firmly rooted in the phenomenal world.

### Why Does Change Happen?

Why is change so pervasive? Why can’t the world of phenomena simply remain static? Upon examining reality and integrating my knowledge of the world, a pattern emerges: the world "wants" to be static but cannot achieve it.

Take physical objects as an example. A stationary object "wants" to remain at rest. However, in a dynamic world, external forces inevitably act upon it. When one object moves and encounters another, an interaction occurs, resulting in change. This interaction resolves the conflict—the attempt of two entities to occupy the same space—by altering their states, such as separation, adhesion, or fragmentation.

### Change as Conflict Resolution

Change appears to be a mechanism for resolving conflicts. For instance, in the example above, the conflict arose from spatial overlap. The resolution brought both entities to a new state of rest, albeit different from their original states.

This insight leads me to a bold claim that I will explore throughout this book: the phenomenal world is inherently conflictual. Conflicts, whether spatial or otherwise, are inevitable and drive change. The world strives for rest but is perpetually disrupted by the emergence of conflicts.

### Greedy Mechanisms of Conflict Resolution

In the phenomenal world, conflict resolution is often "greedy." Entities do not make strategic sacrifices; they either evade conflict or consume resources to satisfy immediate needs. For example, carbon atoms form complex molecules by lowering their energy states, yet their growth introduces structural vulnerabilities. Similarly, biological systems, including my body and mind, strive to maintain homeostasis—a state of equilibrium—by addressing conflicts like hunger or fatigue.

Even human activities are conflict-driven. Eating resolves the conflict of hunger, while entertainment provides stimulation to maintain mental equilibrium. Stories, for instance, captivate us because they involve conflicts that are resolved. Our minds thrive on solving problems, requiring conflict to resolve other conflicts.

### The Role of Conflict in Understanding

Conflict is central to understanding the phenomenal world. The question "Why?" embodies this necessity. At its core, "Why?" asks about the necessity of a process—about the conflict being resolved. Whether it is oxygen "taking" electrons during combustion or my mind engaging with ideas to solve problems, all processes involve interaction and conflict resolution.

This pattern of conflict resolution appears universal. Observing change without an underlying conflict is inconceivable because every effect must have a cause. To claim otherwise is self-contradictory. Thus, the presupposition that "every change requires a conflict" is foundational. While it may not be strictly a priori knowledge, it is a deeply useful and widely accepted principle underpinning science, philosophy, and daily reasoning.

### Toward Deeper Insights

This principle is integral to the framework I am building. Understanding why change occurs—why conflicts arise and are resolved—offers profound insights into the nature of reality. The "why" question drives us to uncover the fundamental mechanisms of the phenomenal world, illuminating the interplay of necessity, conflict, and resolution.
