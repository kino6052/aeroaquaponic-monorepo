## The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Part 2: Chapter 5: Faith

If the why question is the most important question to ask, then the meaning of life is the most fundamental why question. And, although there exists no agreement on this subject, I will have to answer it for myself either way.

This question could be paraphrased as what is the ultimate goal of life as an activity?

I approach this question by imagining that all of a sudden all my needs and wants are completely fulfilled. The keyword here is “completely”. And this is not easy to imagine because there are just so many needs and wants. I would not need to breath, would not need to look at things, would not need to move. Like if I were frozen, only I would not be. I would be just completely stationary on the outside as well as on the inside. Why would I bother to move if I don’t need to?

Any action or activity is there as an attempt to fulfill a need or a want. Needs and wants are there because as a part of the phenomenal world, I am incomplete.

Life as an activity has only one goal — completion. Physical homeostasis, trying to maintain balance, non-stop. Unlike inorganic matter, living beings are capable of maintaining their integrity as a system. Living organisms are informational beings, where the information they carry tells them what form they are, not only physical shape but an entire description of what they are, how they behave, and so on. They are also given mechanisms to maintain this form.

This homeostasis of living beings like myself is maintained on many levels, ranging from a single cell up to the entire society all trying to achieve completion of all their needs and wants.

Because I only become aware of my needs through experience, through my perception, the wants I may have are interpretations of the sensory input about my needs. I often misinterpret my needs and want things I don’t need at all. This brings me back to the first chapter where I discussed that this book is an attempt to overcome confusion and incoherent understanding of the world that caused much dissatisfaction and grief. As well as causing misinterpretation of needs.

Although needs are hard to fulfill because I am not fully aware of them, I also recognize that this goal is not achievable because there is death. There is personal death, and all our struggles for completeness end up being just useless stir; similarly, there is the death of those I care about. Every living being that exists will sooner or later die just because it can, and it will not be able to attain the stasis it is after. The same thing is true of a population, a species, and so on.

The main conflict that is trying to be resolved in the activity of life is that of incompleteness. However, because conflict and its resolution through change is at the core of the phenomenal world, it will never be attained, and I can know this with certainty.

This contradiction seems to be a cruel joke. Like if I was a donkey with a dangling carrot in front of me or Sisyphus endlessly pushing a rock uphill.

So a natural question arises, is there a way out of this strange dream? What is this dream really about?

As a modern man, I’ve had a reference frame of the world for a very long time, and it seemed that death was a way out of this world that would grant non-existence; because it was unavoidable, I naturally thought that was always going to be there as a last resort, so its better to see the life through. Choosing the latter was really just an excuse to cruise along and get high. This attitude was really just covering up laziness, cowardice, and egotism.

But once I changed my reference frame, I wasn’t so sure about this anymore. Knowing that my mind is seeing dreams in the cinema of experience. To die turns into “to sleep; perchance to dream: ay there’s the rub: for in that sleep of death what dreams may come?”. These famous words of Hamlet by William Shakespeare ring very true in this reference frame. In this reference frame, death needs to be taken seriously. It needs to be understood and prepared for.

So what are my options? How can I escape this dream where I know that I and everybody I care about will die thus rendering all my pursuits futile?

Luckily, the longing to escape this world of change and death was shared by many throughout the centuries. This longing manifested itself in many religions.

Not all religions offer a better option for the afterlife. The majority of mythological systems depict their gods as incomplete, just like humans, but more powerful in many regards, usually in physical strength. Take the Greeks, Romans, Vikings, and various other traditions as an example.

However, there exist traditions that offer a complete escape, a complete fulfillment. The greatest contenders that I am aware of in that regard are Christianity and Buddhism. Both of these belief systems offer a way to escape the phenomenal world.

Before talking about Christianity and Buddhism, I have to be very careful describing my understanding, as it is known that in the domain of religion, misconceptions are especially dangerous and can lead to uncontrollable musings that end up either leading to complete madness or affecting the reputation of faith as such. I don’t want either of these scenarios.

I know very little about Buddhism, as the majority of practitioners of it that I personally interacted with were the Westerners affected by Alan Watts, and similar Buddhism popularizers, who unavoidably provided it as a counter-measure to Christianity. This Buddhism was not pure, but just a popular “anti-Christian” movement, and I am sure had very little in common with real Buddhism.

However, I studied it a little bit in a philosophy class, I read some of the texts, watched some videos, and visited the temples. Up to this point, I still have a lot of work to do to catch up and form an understanding of this tradition. But at this point, my understanding tells me that Buddhism is more about answering “how” to escape rather than “why”. It appears to be a form of algorithm.

Christianity is unique, however. In it, each person, like you and me, is in the center of the cosmos. In other traditions, like the mythological ones I mentioned before, humans are often just a marginal group that often plays no critical role.

Christianity tells us that the universe was created as a condition for us to exist, for beings capable of making free decisions — a gift so powerful, that it turned into a source of misery for us.

In Christianity, the main conflict behind the phenomenal world — is the problem of good and evil. Once the first people misused their will and turned away from God, the phenomenal world had altered and so did human nature. Human nature turned mortal and the human will has become corrupted and as such more inclined to turn away from God even more. The more it turned away the more damage had been caused.

God transcends the phenomenal world and it is not possible to understand His intentions with absolute certainty, however, Christianity tells us that the fix to the problems that happened since then is not something up to us. It is God who fixes this. The only action required of us is to trust Him, turn toward Him, and receive help, but not on our terms.

In Christianity, God not only cares about people, He is willing to sacrifice Himself to save them. He is willing to take part in their suffering by becoming a man to help them go through it because this experience is a condition for a successful escape from the consequences of the misuse of free will and to learn how this gift needs to be used. The incarnate God — Jesus Christ then goes through one of the worst physical torments known at the time — crucifixion, being betrayed and hated by the people who were chosen to preserve God’s Truth — the Hebrews.

My simplified understanding of Christianity is just a very diluted one. To have a glimpse into the depth of the divine nature of Christianity, you can observe an interesting phenomenon — dialectical contradictions. Naturally, you would expect that when divinity meets humanity, things get weird.

The most natural thing to expect from the Divine entering our world is that there will be contradictions irreconcilable by our mind. I call these “dialecticisms”.

Birth of God in flesh.

Virgin giving birth.

The King of kings is born in the manger

“Most righteous” pharisees are worse than the toll workers.

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle

Repented thief is first to enter the Kingdom of Heaven

Metaphors (not complicated stories) are best for understanding of what lies beyond.

The ultimate contradiction is that God was killed by his chosen people. When it is put like that, the mind refuses to believe it, but it is exactly what happened. If this is the case, then what hope can we have? The best of the best ended up being not only murders but the worst kind of murders conceivable. Does this contradiction even have a possibility of resolution? Can we have any other hope than to be smitten and reduced to dust? Christianity tells us that God is Love — the sacrificial and forgiving kind. It tells us when we find ourselves having committed the worst sin possible, there is no way out but to ask God for help. Turning to God for help is the ultimate resolution of all the crazy contradictions because God can fix anything.

In Christianity all the emphasis is outside of the phenomenal world and that what makes Christianity the greatest contender for being the True faith. In it, politics are not important. “Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation.” In it, money is not important.

There is no precise algorithm other than trusting God. It’s not a point-collection game. Reward is not based on how many points you collect. The reward is based on how strong faith is. It is not beneficial to think of faith as any other skill that I can build. If I start approaching similar as with points, I will soon fall into contradictions. I will start competing for these points. I will be comparing myself to others, I will think that I am better than others based on how many points you have. It is also not laziness, where I just lazily say that only God can figure something out and so on, so I can take it easy. It is very personal, something only between me and God that will be tested throughout my life as I face difficult situations that tell me about who I really am and where I stand with God. If I don’t learn through my life that I am a very modest creature at best, then I don’t learn anything.

And only through God that I find hope for the resolution of this predicament. Knowing that I will most likely fail myself and others when faced with a tough situation, I really start praying hard with all my heart.

Even though I am pretty sure that my faith is not very strong, I still don’t panic, as I know that God knows our heart, and if we are willing to work on ourselves will give us as many chances as we need (and even more) to improve the situation.

Essentially, what keeps me going is that I know that God is there for me and will always be there for me. He is the kindest and most loving beyond imagination. Unlike some kind people that are kind because it helps them to avoid conflict and feel better about their otherwise weaknesses, He is ultimately strong spirited, and is courageous beyond imagination, if we were to speak about Him in human terms. So His love isn’t just given to be thrown away, you will have to fight for it and you will be rewarded (always).

In it, suffering has meaning because it is related to the process of escaping this phenomenal world. The path is going to be tough, but with God, it is going to be possible.

To conclude, Christianity and the idealistic reference frame answer the question of the meaning of life very well. I treasure this faith because of how profound it is, how well it addresses the conflict of the phenomenal world, and for its explanatory power.

I am now ready to further examine the phenomenal world and see how I can further keep building my understanding.
