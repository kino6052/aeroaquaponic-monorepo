## The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Part 1: Chapter 4: Change

Having established my reference frame, I now could further examine the world of phenomenons, the world of experiences.

The most basic thing that I could say about the world, and I concur with that with Immanuel Kant and other philosophers, is that it is in time and space, which according to Immanuel Kant and Geroge Berkley is an inseparable aspect of our experience and even is a condition for it, or, in other words, we couldn’t perceive anything outside space and time.

But I am aware of space and time because things change. I am aware of it when spatial aspects shift in time, for example, an apple fell off a tree. I can make a connection between the apple on the ground and the apple in my memory as one and the same but in two different time and space instances.

This makes the concept of change even more fundamental, in my opinion than that of space and time, as I can only become aware of them through observing how things change.

In the history of philosophy, Georg Hegel is a prominent figure who placed change at the core of his system. Despite the significant role change will play in the foundation I am building, I choose not to incorporate Hegel’s ideas into my framework. I believe his ideas exemplify faulty philosophy.

Firstly, Hegel completely disregarded the works of Immanuel Kant, who established anti-metaphysical guardrails that protect the mind from falling into fantasizing. Kant’s critical philosophy, particularly his emphasis on the limits of human knowledge and the distinction between phenomena and noumena, serves as a safeguard against speculative metaphysics. Hegel, however, is blinded by the algorithm of dialectics, using it to fantasize about the world’s destined evolution into a Utopia or an absolute spirit. This speculative nature of his dialectical method often leads to grandiose and unverified claims.

Secondly, because change is only an attribute of the phenomenal world — the world of experiences — it cannot be applied to a priori knowledge such as mathematics and logic. Mathematics and logic exist independently of the phenomenal world and are not subject to the changes observed in our experiences. By conflating the phenomenal world with a priori knowledge, Hegel’s framework overlooks this critical distinction.

Thirdly, Hegel’s writing style is notoriously inaccessible and incomprehensible. The challenge of deciphering philosophical texts is already considerable, but Hegel’s dense and convoluted prose further alienates readers and obscures his ideas. This lack of clarity stands in stark contrast to the importance of accessibility and precision in philosophical discourse.

While I do not intend to thoroughly criticize Hegel in my work, I will selectively use some of his ideas in a more careful manner. For instance, his notion of change can be valuable if adapted thoughtfully and grounded in a rigorous empirical framework. By doing so, I aim to avoid the speculative pitfalls of Hegelian dialectics and ensure that my philosophical foundation remains clear, accessible, and rooted in the realities of the phenomenal world.

So when I think about change, I ask myself why things change in the first place. Why this world of phenomenons cannot be simply static? And, in fact, when I observe reality and scramble all the knowledge I have about the world together, a pattern emerges. This world does “want” to be static. But it can’t.

For example, physical entities “want” to remain at rest, meaning that in certain reference frames, they don’t move at all, we have to remember that all spatial and temporal aspects of the world are relative (see Berkley), however, at certain times there is a possibility that there is something else that moves passing it by. As the passer-by attempts to occupy the space of the original entity. Then an interaction happens resulting in change, and the two entities are either separated or glued to each other or reduced to crumbs.

Now why an interaction had to happen? I believe that in order to answer this question, I can look at the result of the interaction. In the end, the original entities ended up in a state of rest again, although in a slightly different way than originally. The interaction between them resulted in the passer-by no longer attempting to occupy the same space, even if, in case where it ended up glued to the first.

Even though this example is a bit abstract, the point is that change seems to be a mechanism for the resolution of conflicts. In our case, the conflict arose due to the fact that one physical entity attempted to occupy the space of another entity.

Now, I will make a bold claim that I will try to justify through the rest of the book. The core aspect of the phenomenal world is that there exists a core contradiction — an inevitability for various conflicts, of which spatial is only one aspect. These conflicts are resolved through change. Although the world is attempting to remain at rest, it can’t because in it things are inevitably, sooner or later, coming into conflict.

However, conflict resolution in the phenomenal world is almost always greedy. Things of various sorts do not make strategic sacrifices. I will later demonstrate that avoiding greedy mechanisms is what intelligence does. As such, things of the phenomenal world are avoiding conflict at all costs by either “jumping away” from it, or by attempting to steal what is missing, thus resulting in a more complex structure, of which large carbon molecules could be an interesting example, where each carbon atom attempts to attain lower energy state (in fact, and I will show it later, energy is just another word for conflict), yet the more it attempts to grow the more problematic the integrity of the structure becomes.

Although, biological and informational systems will require a separate discussion, I want to note that my mind and body are also subject to the conflict of interests. They want to fulfill their needs. They want to remain in homeostasis.

Any activity I have is there to resolve some conflict. For example, the most basic conflict that the activity of food consumption resolves is that it provides fuel for the machinery of my body to keep its homeostasis, its proper function. Or, for example, entertainment is also similar to food consumption, but it is rather the food for our nervous system, so it can maintain its proper function.

Take stories for example, our minds not only require just any information, but they also require information to contain a conflict that gets resolved. Our minds want to solve problems. In essence, there is a contradiction as we need conflict to resolve another conflict. I believe that this is the hallmark of the phenomenal world — contradictions are resolved in space and time all the while creating possibilities for other contradictions.

Our minds require conflict. The main embodiment of such conflict is the “why” question. The real question that “why” asks is “Why is it necessary”. The necessity of any process is about conflict resolution between interacting entities. For burning, oxygen is taking away things it “wants” from other atoms and throwing away energy in the form of heat. For thinking, the mind interacts with ideas to solve problems. For communication, there is interaction between entities that understand information conveyed in a certain form (signal).

Although it is hard to say whether the patter of conflict resolution holds for absolutely everything in the phenomenal world, however, to see that something has changed without a true conflict (not just an apparent one) seems to be impossible to acquire for we have to have exact knowledge of why something changed, and if it changed without a reason, we need to know that there is really no reason. This seems a contradiction of terms, because if there is no reason for something to change, why would it bother This contradiction makes me think that our causal understanding is in fact more like apriori understanding because to say that something doesn’t have a cause is impossible to prove while something having a cause — is provable. I believe it to be apriori because I discovered it just like 2 + 2 = 4 with just a few examples from the real world and I then have certainty that it will work for any case.

However, even if it is not a true apriori knowledge in the sense that the knowledge of causes lies in experience, and rather a presupposition that every effect requires a cause, and paraphrased “every change requires a conflict”, it seems a very useful one and fundamental one that all sciences and philosophies and people take for granted.

It is useful in the context of the construct that I am describing. Because it is concerned with the fundamental necessity. The answer to the “why” question provides the most deep insights into any subject.
