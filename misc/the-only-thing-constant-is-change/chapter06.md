**The Only Thing Constant Is Change: Part 2: Chapter 6: Science**

I was often told that science is the best tool for studying the world because it explains it. However, science does not explain *why* things are one way or the other; it only explains *how* things work. I hope I have demonstrated that the “why” question is best addressed through philosophical examination.

The chief limitation of all sciences is their siloed nature. Chemistry is studied separately from physics, physics apart from biology, and mathematics knows little of computer science, and so on. From a design standpoint, this separation is logical: it ensures focus and scope. Yet, it also prevents the sciences from sharing a common foundational ground. This fragmentation leads to a kaleidoscopic understanding of the world instead of a unified one, where the phenomenal world—in certain reference frames—becomes consistent and comprehensible.

In this chapter, I will attempt to further develop my understanding of the phenomenal world by exploring the common ground behind all sciences.

Logic and mathematics are widely regarded as the foundational knowledge underpinning all scientific disciplines. Immanuel Kant famously stated, “In any special doctrine of nature there can be only as much proper science as there is mathematics therein” (4:470). These sciences hold their elevated status because they are untainted by the phenomena of experience. They arise from *a priori* knowledge—innate knowledge accessible to the human mind.

Logic, for example, is intrinsic to our reasoning. Without formally learning it, we use logical structures—implications, syllogisms, negations—when speaking any language, albeit often imprecisely. Logic as a discipline clarifies, organizes, and combines these patterns. It does not generate new knowledge but sharpens our understanding of what is already within us. This reveals that many answers lie hidden within the mind itself.

Mathematics, on the other hand, is logic amplified. By adding rules and axioms to logical structures, mathematics creates an entire body of knowledge. Unlike logic, it not only clarifies but produces new insights. Kant referred to this as “synthetic *a priori* knowledge.”

Mathematics concerns itself with fundamental manipulations of categories to create structures. Since the phenomena of experience also manifest as structures that correspond to the mind’s categories, mathematics is aptly called the language of the universe. This explains the deeply mathematical nature of physics. Physics applies mathematics to the phenomenal world, confining it to a specific frame: the “physical world” with its space, time, energy, mass, and governing laws.

At physics’s core is the concept of energy—a parameter indicating the amount of change within a system. I find the term “energy” misleading; “amount of conflict” might better capture its essence. Because motion is relative, energy only exists within systems of multiple entities, where conflicts arise from their interactions. These conflicts drive change, described in physics as force. Thus, physics interprets phenomena through energy and forces, establishing itself as a fundamental science of the phenomenal world.

However, this perspective can be extrapolated beyond atoms and molecules to other observed structures, such as storytelling, music, or human activities. All these involve conflict resolution, as previously discussed.

Living organisms present a unique phenomenon. While organisms share qualities with inorganic matter, they possess additional attributes. They are informational systems, carrying data that guide their development and maintenance. Although evolution is often cited as the origin of life, evolution itself is an informational process. The “population + natural selection” system has the rules and feedback mechanisms characteristic of informational systems. Where there is information, there is a mind behind it. Information is not the signal—be it sound waves, electrical impulses, or DNA sequences—but the meaning the signal conveys. Meaning is a construct of the mind, not the phenomenal world.

Lastly, consider computer science. Of all disciplines, it most closely mirrors the themes of this book. Software development is an act of building structures—much like constructing understanding. A software structure must correspond to a correctly functioning program. Yet, even a working program can suffer from poor structure, leading to complications—akin to the problems caused by a fragmented understanding of the world.

Software exists within the phenomenal world and, like everything else, is subject to conflict and change. Its name—“software”—reflects the need for adaptability. A proper structure must not only be correct but also flexible, capable of accommodating changes. Flexibility arises from simplicity and a deep understanding of the conflicts driving those changes.

For example, a banking application might treat accounts and cards as entirely separate entities. This design could cause headaches if cards eventually need to function as a type of account, requiring duplicate functionality. The underlying conflict is the user’s need to perform similar operations on both. Similarly, a project consolidating user data from multiple systems might fail due to the complexity of reconciling information. Here, the conflict stems from users’ desire for a unified data source to meet specific needs.

To conclude, this chapter examines science through the lens of the mind and the concepts explored in earlier chapters. By finding a common ground across disciplines, it moves closer to building a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenal world.
