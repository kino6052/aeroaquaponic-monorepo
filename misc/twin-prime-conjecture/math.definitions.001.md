Okay, let's explicitly define the mathematical concepts based _only_ on the provided article for the "Computational Prime Number Framework". These definitions form the basis upon which statements within this specific framework can be analyzed or proven.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **Natural Numbers (`N`)**: The set of integers starting from 2 (`{2, 3, 4, ...}`). Conceptually treated as an infinite list when used in the recursive processes, though finite lists are used for runnable examples. In the context of the `twin_sieve`, `N` refers to a list of positive integers (`{1, 2, 3, ...}`) used as indices.

2.  **Sieve (`sieve(P, N)`)**: A function that takes two lists as input:

    - `P`: A list of numbers (intended to be known primes within the framework).
    - `N`: A list of natural numbers (starting > 1).
      It returns a new list containing only those numbers `n` from `N` such that `n` is not divisible by any number `p` in `P` (i.e., `n % p != 0` for all `p` in `P`).
      _(Reference: `sieve` function definition, FAQ 0.a)_

3.  **Recursive Sifting Process**: An iterative procedure defined as follows:

    - Start with an initial list of primes `P` (usually empty, `[]`) and the list of natural numbers `N` (starting from 2).
    - **Step:** Apply the `sieve(P, N)` function to get a filtered list, let's call it `N'`.
    - If `N'` is empty, the process terminates, and the current list `P` is the result.
    - If `N'` is not empty, find the smallest number in `N'`, call it `next_prime`.
    - Add `next_prime` to the list `P`.
    - Repeat the **Step** using the updated `P` and the list `N'`.
      The conceptual result of this potentially infinite process is the final list `P`.

4.  **Prime Number**: Within this framework, this term has two related meanings:
    - **(General Sense / Sieve Output):** Any number that _results from_ (i.e., is present in the output list of) a single application of the `sieve(P, N)` function for a given `P`. These are the numbers in `N` not divisible by any element of `P`; the "holes" in the sieve relative to `P`.
    - **(Generated Sense / Recursive Output):** A number that is an element of the final list `P` generated by the `recursive_sifting` process. The article states this process generates the set of prime numbers as conventionally understood.
      _(Reference: "Definition of Prime" section, FAQ 0.b, FAQ 12)_

**Twin Prime Related Concepts:**

5.  **Twin Prime Candidate**: Any number belonging to the set generated by applying the initial sieve `sieve([2, 3], N)`, where N is the set of natural numbers starting from 2. These candidates are noted to be expressible in the form `6n Â± 1` for `n >= 1`.
    _(Reference: "Twin Primes Proof" section, first paragraph)_

6.  **Twin Prime Index**: A positive integer `n` (`1, 2, 3, ...`) used to represent a potential twin prime pair `(6n-1, 6n+1)`. The `twin_sieve` and `twin_recursive_sifting` processes operate on these indices.
    _(Reference: `twin_sieve` parameters, FAQ 0.c, FAQ 3)_

7.  **Twin Sieve (`twin_sieve(P_indices, N_indices)`)**: A function that operates on lists of _indices_:

    - `P_indices`: A list of indices `p` corresponding to previously identified steps or prime pairs in the twin sifting process (starts with `[1]`).
    - `N_indices`: A list of natural number indices `n` (starting from 1).
      It returns a filtered list containing only those indices `n` from `N_indices` such that _both_ numbers in the pair `(6n-1, 6n+1)` pass a divisibility test: neither `6n-1` nor `6n+1` should be divisible by `6p-1` or `6p+1` for any index `p` from `1` up to the largest index currently in `P_indices`.
      _(Reference: `twin_sieve` function definition, docstring, FAQ 0.c, FAQ 13)_

8.  **Twin Recursive Sifting Process**: An iterative procedure defined as follows:

    - Start with an initial list of twin prime indices `P_indices` (usually `[1]`) and the list of natural number indices `N_indices` (starting from 1).
    - **Step:** Apply the `twin_sieve(P_indices, N_indices)` function to get a filtered list of indices, let's call it `result`.
    - If `result` is empty, the process terminates, and the current list `P_indices` is the result.
    - If `result` is not empty, find the smallest index in `result`, call it `next_index`.
    - Add `next_index` to the list `P_indices`.
    - Repeat the **Step** using the updated `P_indices` and the list `result`.
      The conceptual result of this potentially infinite process is the final list `P_indices`.
      _(Reference: `twin_recursive_sifting` function definition)_

9.  **Twin Prime Pair**: Within this framework, a pair of numbers `(6n-1, 6n+1)` where the index `n` is an element of the final list `P_indices` generated by the `twin_recursive_sifting` process. These are the pairs corresponding to the indices that survive the entire twin sifting process; the "holes" in the twin sieve.

These definitions establish the specific meanings of terms within the "Computational Prime Number Framework" as described in the article. Any proof constructed should rely solely on these definitions and the described processes (like the recursive nature of the sieves).
