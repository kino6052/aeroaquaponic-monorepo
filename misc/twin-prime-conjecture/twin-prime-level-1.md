## Introduction

This article describes several mathematical proofs using a conceptual framework called the "Computational Prime Number Framework" at three levels of detail.

This article is the least detailed (Level 1).

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how simple yet unconventional definitions can lead to interesting mathematical insights.

**This article doesn't claim to have proven longstanding conjectures within conventional number theory. The proofs are only valid within this framework.**

## Why this Argument is Likely to Be Rejected by Mathematicians

This argument does not rely on conventional definitions of prime numbers and does not use a "rigorous" mathematical proof structure. Instead, it relies more on demonstration and simple logic.

## Sieve

```python
def sieve(P, N):
    """
    Filters out numbers from N (natural numbers) that are divisible by any element in P (primes).

    Parameters:
      P (list): Known primes.
      N (list): List of numbers to filter (starting with numbers > 1).

    Returns:
      list: Numbers from N that are not divisible by any element in P.
    """
    return [n for n in N if all(n % p != 0 for p in P)]

print(sieve([2], [n for n in range(2, 40)]))
# [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39]

print(sieve([2,3], [n for n in range(2, 40)]))
# [5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, 37]
```

## Sifting Process

```python
def recursive_sifting(P, N):
    """
    Recursively applies the sieve function to generate primes.

    Parameters:
      P (list): Known primes.
      N (list): List of natural numbers (starting with numbers > 1) (assumed infinite conceptually).

    Returns:
      list: An infinite conceptual sequence of primes (limited by recursion depth in practice).
    """
    N = sieve(P, N)
    if not N:
        return P

    # Add the smallest filtered number as the next prime
    next_prime = N[0]
    P.append(next_prime)
    return recursive_sifting(P, N)

# Example usage (finite number N is used for demonstration purposes):
print(recursive_sifting([], [n for n in range(2, 50)]))
# [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
```

## Definition of Prime

Primes in our framework are defined as numbers resulting from a sieve like the one above.

If we have a finite set P, then our primes will not only be P themselves but also include numbers that are not multiples of any element in P.

```python
# Example primes resulting from P = [2]
print(sieve([2], [n for n in range(2, 40)]))
# [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39]
```

Essentially, they are the "holes" in the sieve.

However, if we iteratively update the sieve by adding the first element from the result to P, we will obtain exactly the set of prime numbers.

```python
# Example usage (finite number N is used for demonstration purposes):
print(recursive_sifting([], [n for n in range(2,50)]))
# [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
```

## Euclid's Proof

The original proof states that for any finite set of primes, one can construct a number that is not divisible by any of them, thus contradicting the assumption of finiteness.

Here, we assert that every step of the sifting process is guaranteed to have an infinite candidate list, and we can always select the first number from that list. Thus, we will always keep adding new numbers to our resulting set, thereby proving that there are an infinite number of such numbers.

```python
# NOT EXECUTABLE
# Euclid's Proof

# Inductive step 1
sieve([2], [n for n in range(2, float('inf'))])
# [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...]

# Inductive step 2
sieve([2, 3], [n for n in range(2, float('inf'))])
# [5, 7, 9, 11, ...]

# Assume there is a number k (resulting from sieve) that will not generate any further candidates.

# Inductive step k
sieve([2,3,5,7...,k], [n for n in range(2, float('inf'))])
# [5*7*11*...*k+1, 5*7*11*...*k*2+1, ...,5*7*11*...*k*n+1]

# Since k continues to generate infinitely many candidates that contradicted our assumption, we conclude that an infinite number of primes must exist.
```

Thus, we are guaranteed to have an infinite number of primes through this process.

## Twin Primes Proof

The twin prime conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by 2.

In our framework, "twin prime candidates" are generated by the following sieve:

```python
# NOT EXECUTABLE
sieve([2,3], N)
# [5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, 37]
```

They can be generalized as `S({2, 3}) = {6n ± 1}`.

Every further step in the iteration will remove some of the numbers. However, the candidates that remain are the twin prime candidates.

Here, we construct a sieve similar to the original, but instead of sieving the numbers themselves, we sieve the indices of twin prime candidates.

```python
sieve([2,3], N)
# [5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, 37]

# n = 1 => (6*1-1, 6*1+1) => (5,7)
# n = 2 => (6*2-1, 6*2+1) => (11,13)
# ...
# n = 5 => (6*5-1, 6*5+1) => (29,31)
```

```python
def twin_sieve(P, N):
    """
    Filters the list N for twin prime candidates based on divisibility tests.

    The sieve operates on indices n where both (6n-1) and (6n+1) are prime candidates.

    return list(filter(

            # up to the current sieve step, leaving only potential twin primes.
            # The form (6p ± 1) covers all primes > 3 due to the initial sieve([2,3]).
        ),
        N
    ))

# NOTE: This is essentially the same as sieve(P, N) function above, but it allows to map values
# more conveniently, so that we could accumulate twin-primes as a result (mapped from "indices")

# Example usage (finite number N is used for demonstration purposes)

print("Twin prime candidate indices:", candidates)
print("Twin prime candidates:", [(6*c-1, 6*c+1) for c in candidates])

# Twin prime candidate indices: [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 17, 18, 23, 25, 28, 30, 32, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 42, 45, 47]

## Step 2
candidates = twin_sieve([1,2], range(1, 50))
print("Twin prime candidate indices:", candidates)
print("Twin prime candidates:", [(6*c-1, 6*c+1) for c in candidates])

## Twin Sifting Process

```python
# Theoretical Proof of Infinite Twin Primes (Non-executable demonstration)

# Base Case: Initial sieve with first prime index
twin_sieve([1], list(range(1, float('inf'))))
# Result: [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, ...] - First set of twin prime candidate indices

# Inductive Step 2: Sieve with first three prime indices
twin_sieve([1,2,3], list(range(1, float('inf'))))
# Result: [3, 5, 7, 10, ...] - Refined set of candidate indices

# Inductive Hypothesis: Assume there exists a number k (from previous sieve)
# that appears to terminate the sequence of candidates

# Inductive Step k: General case for any k in the sequence
def get_index(candidate):
    """Convert a candidate number to its corresponding index in the 6n±1 form"""
    return (candidate-1)//6

# Apply sieve with all prime indices up to k
twin_sieve([1,2,3,5,7...,k], list(range(1, float('inf'))))
# Result: [get_index(6*(5*7*11*...*k)+1), get_index(6*(5*7*11*...*k*2)+1), ...,
#          get_index(6*(5*7*11*...*k*n)+1)] - New infinite sequence of candidates

# Conclusion: For any k, the sieve generates infinitely many new candidates
# This recursive process never terminates, demonstrating that:
# 1. The set of prime indices P grows infinitely
# 2. Each new index corresponds to a twin prime pair (6n-1, 6n+1)
# 3. Therefore, there must be infinitely many twin primes
```

## Conclusion

This argument is based on a non-conventional definition of primes as resulting from the recursive sifting process. The proof demonstrates that by using the sifting process, we always guarantee that we will obtain the next pair at every step, thus proving that there will be infinitely many twin prime pairs.

## FAQ

0. What are the definitions?
   a. Sieve - a function that filters out multiples of numbers that we pass in.
   b. Prime Number - the result of a sieve. (For a recursive sieve where we select the first number from each step, we will generate a list of prime numbers in their conventional definition.)
   c. Twin Sieve - a sieve that builds on top of `sieve([2,3])` that generates indices (natural numbers) that correspond to a pair from sieve([2,3]) (e.g., for index n, the pair is (6n-1, 6n+1)). This allows us to create a recursive sieve similar to how we created a recursive sieve for Euclid's argument.
   d. Twin Prime Pair - a pair of prime numbers (holes in the sieve) that match the conventional prime definition when a recursive algorithm is used.

1. Why use finite numbers in examples rather than working directly with infinite sets?

   - Practical Demonstration: Finite examples make abstract concepts concrete and verifiable.
   - Pedagogical Approach: Serves as stepping stones to understand infinite cases.
   - Computational Limitation: Python requires finite numbers for execution.
   - Mathematical Foundation: Mirrors induction's use of base cases to build general proofs.

2. Where does the (6n-1, 6n+1) form originate?

   - Sieve Foundation: Derived from applying sieve([2,3]).
   - Mathematical Structure: Captures all primes > 3 in twin prime format.
   - Index Mapping: Enables systematic generation of candidate pairs.
   - Example: Index 1 → (6*1-1, 6*1+1) = (5,7).
   - Connection: Parallels recursive Euclid's argument.

3. What are twin prime indices and how do they work?

   - Definition: Numerical positions in the 6n±1 sequence.
   - Generation: Produced through sieve([2,3]) filtering.
   - Mapping: Each index corresponds to a potential twin prime pair.
   - Example: Index 1 → (5,7), Index 2 → (11,13).
   - Purpose: Provides framework for recursive sifting process.

4. Does the algorithm guarantee that all remaining pairs are actual twin primes?

   - Within our framework, the remaining pairs are twin primes by definition - they represent the "holes" in our sifting process. As we approach infinity, these holes converge to the traditional definition of twin primes. This is analogous to how the sieve of Eratosthenes identifies primes through elimination, with the key difference being our focus on twin prime pairs rather than individual primes.

5. How does this computational framework relate to the conventional proof approaches for the twin prime conjecture?

   - The conventional proof approach relies on the assumption that since we know there are infinite prime numbers (from Euclid's proof), we now have to rely on that knowledge somehow to prove that there are twin primes. The main problem with this approach is that we have to forget that there are infinitely many prime numbers to prove the infinitude of twin primes - because we have to construct a recursive sieve with arbitrarily large steps where we can demonstrate that we will always be able to get a new pair. The fact that we know there exist infinitely many primes is the main hurdle for thinking about the argument. We can see that the twin prime sieve actually gives us not twin prime candidates but actual twin primes while filtering all composites under the hood.

6. Can the computational approach be extended to other prime patterns beyond twins (like prime triplets or cousin primes)?

   - Yes, it would be easy to construct a sieve similar to the recursive twin prime sieve that we demonstrated and do analogous arguments for arbitrarily large gaps. For example, we can see that sieve([2,3]) (congruent modulo 6 or repeating after every 6 numbers) has (5,7) and (11,13), where 7 and 11 would correspond to a gap of 4, 7 and 13 would correspond to gap 6, and 5 and 13 would have a gap of 8, and so on. This means that we now need to construct a function that would take (6n-1,6n+3) or (6n-1,6n+5) or (6n-3, 6n+3), or (6n-3, 6n+5) and so on and accumulate those while removing compound numbers.

7. What is the time complexity of the twin sieve algorithm, and how does it compare to other computational approaches?

   - This is not relevant to the argument; we are only interested in the infinitude. Python implementation was used to be as clear of a demonstration as possible.

8. How does induction work in the argument?

   - The argument employs mathematical induction in the following way:
   - Base Case: We demonstrate the process works for initial steps, showing the sieve generates valid twin prime candidates.
   - Inductive Hypothesis: Assume the sieve successfully generates twin prime candidates up to some arbitrary step k.
   - Inductive Step: We prove that if the hypothesis holds for step k, it must also hold for step k+1. This is achieved by:
     - Showing the recursive sieve structure preserves the generation of new candidates
     - Demonstrating that at each step, the sieve cannot eliminate all potential candidates
     - Proving the process remains valid for arbitrarily large k
   - Conclusion: Since the base case holds and the inductive step is valid for any k, the sieve must generate twin prime candidates indefinitely. This establishes the infinitude of twin primes through the inductive nature of the recursive sieve process.

9. Does this approach yield any insights about the distribution of twin primes or their density?

   - The infinitude argument does not require distribution knowledge. It is a false supposition. The infinitude argument only needs to show the infinitude. Distribution knowledge is a completely different concern. As a software engineer, it is hard for me to tolerate such violation of concern separation.

10. What empirical validation has been done to verify this approach aligns with known twin prime distributions for large numbers?

    - The beauty of math (especially many inductive arguments) lies in the fact that it can be verified within the confines of pure logic alone. The fact that we need computational verification seems to be a turn in the wrong direction somewhere in mathematical thinking.

11. Why does each sieve step generate an infinite candidate list?

    - Because for each step (e.g., [2,3,5] that sieves all multiples of 2 or 3) we can construct infinitely many such candidates (e.g., 2*3*5*n-1 or 2*3*5*n+1 or similar).

12. Why does recursive sifting obtain conventional primes?

    - The recursive sifting process systematically builds the set of primes through elimination:
      - Initialization: Starts with the first prime (2) and all natural numbers > 1
      - Recursive Step: At each iteration:
        1. Filters out multiples of known primes using the sieve
        2. The smallest remaining number is identified as prime
        3. This new prime is added to the known primes set
      - Guarantee: Each new prime is the smallest number not divisible by any previous primes
      - Convergence: The process continues indefinitely, generating all primes
      - Parallel: The twin prime sieve follows the same recursive elimination principle, but operates on pairs of the form (6n-1, 6n+1)

13. Where is the guarantee that twin sieve results are not composite and that the sieve actually eliminates all compound numbers?

    - The guarantee comes from our comprehensive divisibility check:

    ```
    all(
        (6*n + 1) % (6*p + 1) != 0 and
        (6*n + 1) % (6*p - 1) != 0 and
        (6*n - 1) % (6*p + 1) != 0 and
        (6*n - 1) % (6*p - 1) != 0
        for p in range(1, P[-1]+1)
    )
    ```

    Let's trace through the algorithm to demonstrate:

    For n = 1 and P = [] (initial state):

    - We simply return [1,2,3...n] as our starting indices.

    When we select 1 as our first index (corresponding to (5,7)) and P=[1]:

    We check:

    ```
    (6*1+1) % (6*1+1) != 0 and
    (6*1+1) % (6*1-1) != 0 and
    (6*1-1) % (6*1+1) != 0 and
    (6*1-1) % (6*1-1) != 0
    ```

    Which simplifies to:

    ```
    7 % 7 != 0 and
    7 % 5 != 0 and
    5 % 7 != 0 and
    5 % 5 != 0
    ```

    This evaluates to False (specifically because 5 % 5 = 0 and 7 % 7 = 0), correctly identifying 5 and 7 as our first twin prime pair.

    For the next step, when n = 2 and P=[1]:

    We check:

    ```
    (6*2+1) % (6*1+1) != 0 and
    (6*2+1) % (6*1-1) != 0 and
    (6*2-1) % (6*1+1) != 0 and
    (6*2-1) % (6*1-1) != 0
    ```

    Which simplifies to:

    ```
    13 % 7 != 0 and
    13 % 5 != 0 and
    11 % 7 != 0 and
    11 % 5 != 0
    ```

    This evaluates to True, confirming (11,13) as our next twin prime pair since neither 11 nor 13 is divisible by 5 or 7 (or by 2 or 3, as they were already filtered by sieve([2,3])).

    By iterating this process, we systematically:

    1. Identify candidates in the form (6n-1, 6n+1)
    2. Verify they are not divisible by any previously identified primes
    3. Ensure we check division by all previous prime pairs

    This recursive approach guarantees that at each step, we only retain numbers that are not divisible by any smaller prime, which is precisely the definition of primality. Therefore, our twin prime candidates are guaranteed to be actual twin primes.

## Critical Questions

1. Infinite Process Justification

   - Core Concern: The recursive sieve operates on an infinite list N, but how does this translate to rigorous mathematical proof?
   - Mathematical Perspective: For any finite set of primes P, we must demonstrate the existence of a larger twin prime pair not divisible by any p ∈ P.
   - Implementation Insight: The twin_sieve guarantees an infinite candidate pool at each step. The first valid candidate (6n±1) is confirmed prime through divisibility checks against all numbers in [1, 6n+1], ensuring twin prime status.

2. Twin Prime Sieve Specificity

   - Core Concern: How does filtering indices where both 6n-1 and 6n+1 are prime ensure infinite twin prime pairs?
   - Robustness Test: Comparison with Sieve of Sundaram (which generates primes but not all primes) provides valuable perspective.
   - Analytical Proof: Our inductive approach, particularly the k-step counterexample, demonstrates the indefinite growth of twin prime pairs through rigorous analytical verification.

3. Computational Limits and Theoretical Framework
   - Core Concern: How to reconcile the sieve's infinite recursion with finite computational resources?
   - Philosophical Perspective: The framework serves as a conceptual tool for mathematical reasoning, following Kantian principles of a priori knowledge.
   - Practical Consideration: While the implementation is finite, the mathematical argument remains valid as a means of communication and mental verification, independent of computational constraints.
