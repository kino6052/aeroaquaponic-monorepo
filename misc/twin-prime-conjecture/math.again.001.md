## The Computational Prime Number Framework: Proofs of Infinitude

### Abstract

This document presents proofs for the infinitude of prime numbers and twin prime pairs strictly within the axiomatic system defined by the Computational Prime Number Framework (CPNF). The CPNF defines prime numbers and twin prime pairs procedurally, based on the outcomes of specific recursive filtering algorithms (sieves). The objective is to demonstrate the infinitude of these sets as logical consequences derived solely from the framework's definitions and axioms. The results establish infinitude _for the objects defined within this framework_, without claiming to resolve conjectures in standard number theory using conventional definitions.

### 1. Introduction

Standard number theory defines prime numbers based on their divisors. The Computational Prime Number Framework adopts an alternative, procedural approach. Numbers are classified based on their persistence through iterative sieving processes. This framework allows for the construction of arguments for infinitude based directly on the properties of these defined processes. We present the foundational definitions and axioms of the CPNF and derive theorems concerning the infinitude of Framework Primes and Framework Twin Prime Pairs.

### 2. Foundational Definitions and Axioms

Let `ℕ = {1, 2, 3, ...}` be the set of natural numbers and `ℕ≥k = {k, k+1, k+2, ...}`.

**Definition 2.1 (Sieve Function):**
Let `P ⊂ ℕ≥2` be a finite set and `N' ⊆ ℕ≥2`. The sieve function `sieve: P × N' → N'` is defined as:
`sieve(P, N') = {n ∈ N' | ∀p ∈ P, n mod p ≠ 0}`.
This function filters elements from `N'` that are divisible by any element in `P`.

_Illustration (Python):_

```python
# Illustrates the sieve function
def sieve_illustrative(P, N_list):
  """Filters numbers from N_list divisible by any p in P."""
  return [n for n in N_list if all(n % p != 0 for p in P)]

# Example: sieve({2, 3}, {2, ..., 19})
# print(sieve_illustrative([2, 3], list(range(2, 20))))
# Output: [5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
```

**Definition 2.2 (Recursive Sifting Process for Primes):**
This process generates sequences `(P_i)_{i≥0}` (sets of identified Framework Primes) and `(N_i)_{i≥0}` (sets of candidates).

- **Initialization:** `P_0 = ∅`, `N_0 = ℕ≥2`.
- **Iteration (i ≥ 0):**
  1.  Compute `N'_{i+1} = sieve(P_i, N_i)`.
  2.  If `N'_{i+1} = ∅`, the process terminates.
  3.  Else, let `p_{i+1} = min(N'_{i+1})`.
  4.  Update `P_{i+1} = P_i ∪ {p_{i+1}}`.
  5.  Set `N_{i+1} = N'_{i+1}` (or optionally `N_{i+1} = N'_{i+1} \setminus \{p_{i+1}\}` for subsequent steps).

**Definition 2.3 (Framework Prime Number):**
A number `p` is a _Framework Prime_ if `p ∈ P_k` for some `k ≥ 1` generated by the Recursive Sifting Process (Definition 2.2) assuming it does not terminate. The set of all Framework Primes is denoted `P_F = ∪_{i=1}^∞ P_i`.

**Axiom 2.1 (Infinitude of Natural Numbers):** The set `ℕ` is infinite.

**Axiom 2.2 (Sieve Correctness):** The `sieve` function correctly implements Definition 2.1 based on the properties of modular arithmetic.

**Lemma 2.1 (Non-Termination of Prime Sifting):** For any finite set `P_i ⊂ P_F`, the set `N'_{i+1} = sieve(P_i, ℕ≥2)` is infinite. Consequently, the Recursive Sifting Process (Definition 2.2) applied to the infinite set `ℕ≥2` never terminates.

_Proof of Lemma 2.1:_
Let `P_i = {p_1, ..., p_k}` be any finite set of Framework Primes. Construct the number `M = (∏_{j=1}^k p_j) + 1`. For any `p_j ∈ P_i`, `M mod p_j = (0 + 1) mod p_j = 1`. Thus, `M ≠ 0 mod p_j` for all `p_j ∈ P_i`. By Definition 2.1, `M ∈ sieve(P_i, ℕ≥2)`.
Now, consider numbers of the form `M_m = m * (∏_{j=1}^k p_j) + 1` for `m ∈ ℕ`. For any `p_j ∈ P_i`, `M_m mod p_j = (m * 0 + 1) mod p_j = 1`. Thus, all such `M_m` belong to `sieve(P_i, ℕ≥2)`. Since there are infinitely many choices for `m`, the set `sieve(P_i, ℕ≥2)` is infinite.
Because `N'_{i+1} = sieve(P_i, N_i)` contains `sieve(P_i, ℕ≥2)` (as `N_i ⊆ ℕ≥2` initially and remains infinite), `N'_{i+1}` is non-empty (in fact, infinite) for any finite `P_i`. Therefore, step 2 of the Recursive Sifting Process never occurs, and the process never terminates when `N_0 = ℕ≥2`. □

**Definition 2.4 (Framework Primality Test `IsFrameworkPrime`):**
For the purpose of the twin sieve definition, we define a predicate `IsFrameworkPrime(k)` for `k ∈ ℕ≥5`.
`IsFrameworkPrime(k) := (∀p ∈ P_F, p ≤ √k ⇒ k mod p ≠ 0)`.
_(Note: This aligns with the standard primality test using the known Framework Primes found so far)_.

**Definition 2.5 (Twin Sieve Function):**
Let `I ⊂ ℕ` be a set of indices. The twin sieve function `twin_sieve: I → I` is defined as:
`twin_sieve(I) = {n ∈ I | (6n-1 ≥ 5) ∧ (6n+1 ≥ 5) ∧ IsFrameworkPrime(6n-1) ∧ IsFrameworkPrime(6n+1)}`.
This function selects indices `n` such that _both_ `6n-1` and `6n+1` satisfy the Framework Primality test.

_Illustration (Python Filter):_

```python
# Illustrates the filtering logic of twin_sieve
def is_framework_prime_illustrative(k, known_primes):
  """Checks if k is divisible by any known_primes up to sqrt(k)"""
  if k < 2: return False
  for p in known_primes:
      if p * p > k: break
      if k % p == 0: return False
  return True

def twin_sieve_filter_illustrative(n, known_primes):
   """Checks if index n corresponds to a twin prime pair based on known_primes."""
   a = 6*n - 1
   b = 6*n + 1
   if a < 5 or b < 5: return False # Ensure components are >= 5
   # Check against primes up to sqrt(b) which covers both
   return is_framework_prime_illustrative(a, known_primes) and \
          is_framework_prime_illustrative(b, known_primes)

# Example: Check index n=5 (pair 29, 31) using primes up to 7
# known_framework_primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
# print(twin_sieve_filter_illustrative(5, known_framework_primes)) # Output: True
# print(twin_sieve_filter_illustrative(4, known_framework_primes)) # Output: False (23, 25 - 25 is not prime)
```

**Definition 2.6 (Recursive Sifting Process for Twin Prime Indices):**
This process generates a sequence of sets of indices `(P_{I,i})_{i≥0}`.

- **Initialization:** `P_{I,0} = {1}` (corresponding to the pair (5, 7)). `N_{I,0} = ℕ≥1`.
- **Iteration (i ≥ 0):**
  1.  Let `I'_{i+1} = twin_sieve(N_{I,i})`. _(Note: `twin_sieve` implicitly uses the current set of known Framework Primes `P_F`)_.
  2.  If `I'_{i+1} = ∅`, the process terminates.
  3.  Else, let `n_{i+1} = min(I'_{i+1} \setminus P_{I,i})` (the smallest new index).
  4.  Update `P_{I,i+1} = P_{I,i} ∪ {n_{i+1}}`.
  5.  Set `N_{I,i+1} = N_{I,i}` (or refine based on `I'_{i+1}`).

**Axiom 2.3 (Non-Termination of Twin Sifting - CPNF Core Axiom):** The set `I'_{i+1} = twin_sieve(ℕ≥1)` is infinite. Consequently, the Recursive Sifting Process for Twin Prime Indices (Definition 2.6) never terminates.
*(Motivation/Heuristic for Axiom 2.3: Similar to Lemma 2.1, one can construct candidate pairs `(6n-1, 6n+1)` that avoid divisibility by any finite set of known Framework Primes. For a finite set of twin prime indices `P_{I,i}` and their corresponding prime factors `F = {p | p=6k±1, p is prime, k ∈ P_{I,i}}`, consider numbers related to `M = ∏_{f∈F} f`. Candidates like `(6M-1, 6M+1)` or `(6(M+1)-1, 6(M+1)+1)` often survive sieving by factors in `F`. The framework elevates the observation that such candidates can always be constructed to the axiom that the set of indices `n` for which *both* `6n-1` and `6n+1` are *actually* Framework Primes is infinite.)*

**Definition 2.7 (Framework Twin Prime Index):**
An index `n` is a _Framework Twin Prime Index_ if `n ∈ P_{I,k}` for some `k ≥ 0` generated by the Twin Recursive Sifting Process (Definition 2.6). The set of all Framework Twin Prime Indices is `P*{I,F} = ∪*{i=0}^∞ P\_{I,i}$.

**Definition 2.8 (Framework Twin Prime Pair):**
A pair `(a, b)` is a _Framework Twin Prime Pair_ if `a = 6n-1` and `b = 6n+1` for some `n ∈ P_{I,F}`.

### 3. Theorems and Proofs

**Theorem 3.1 (Infinitude of Framework Primes):** The set `P_F` of Framework Primes is infinite.

_Proof of Theorem 3.1:_
The set `P_F` is generated by the Recursive Sifting Process for Primes (Definition 2.2), starting with `N_0 = ℕ≥2`. By Lemma 2.1, this process never terminates because the set `N'_{i+1}` from which the next prime `p_{i+1}` is chosen is always non-empty (and infinite) for any finite set `P_i`. Since a new, distinct Framework Prime `p_{i+1} = min(N'_{i+1})` is added to the set `P_i` at each iteration `i`, the union `P_F = ∪_{i=1}^∞ P_i` must contain infinitely many elements. □

**Theorem 3.2 (Infinitude of Framework Twin Primes):** The set of Framework Twin Prime Pairs is infinite.

_Proof of Theorem 3.2:_
Framework Twin Prime Pairs are defined by indices in the set `P_{I,F}` (Definitions 2.7, 2.8), which is generated by the Recursive Sifting Process for Twin Prime Indices (Definition 2.6). This process starts with `N_{I,0} = ℕ≥1`.
By Axiom 2.3 (Non-Termination of Twin Sifting), the set `I'_{i+1} = twin_sieve(ℕ≥1)` from which new indices are drawn is infinite. Therefore, the step `I'_{i+1} = ∅` in Definition 2.6 never occurs.
At each iteration `i`, a new, distinct Framework Twin Prime Index `n_{i+1} = min(I'_{i+1} \setminus P_{I,i})` is added to the set `P_{I,i}`. Consequently, the union `P_{I,F} = ∪_{i=0}^∞ P_{I,i}` must contain infinitely many elements.
Since each distinct index `n ∈ P_{I,F}` corresponds to a unique Framework Twin Prime Pair `(6n-1, 6n+1)`, the set of Framework Twin Prime Pairs must also be infinite. □

### 4. Conclusion

The Computational Prime Number Framework provides a self-contained system based on procedural definitions of primes and twin primes using iterative sieves. Within this system, the infinitude of Framework Primes is rigorously demonstrated using a proof analogous to Euclid's (Theorem 3.1, relying on Lemma 2.1). The infinitude of Framework Twin Primes (Theorem 3.2) is derived as a direct consequence of accepting the framework's core axiom regarding the non-termination of the twin index sifting process (Axiom 2.3). The validity of these theorems is contingent upon the acceptance of the CPNF's definitions and axioms.
