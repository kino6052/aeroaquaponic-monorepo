### Computational Prime Number Framework: Twin Primes and Their Infinitude (Level 2)

## Introduction

The Computational Prime Number Framework offers a novel approach to understanding prime numbers through algorithmic and constructive processes rather than classical number theory. Traditional mathematics treats prime numbers as abstract objects with properties derived from axioms and theorems. This framework, however, defines primes dynamically through a computational sieve process, allowing for direct exploration of their behavior.

### Motivation

Prime numbers are a fundamental element of number theory, yet their properties, such as their infinitude and twin prime relationships, remain areas of deep mathematical inquiry. While conventional proofs rely on indirect logical arguments, this framework attempts to demonstrate prime properties through constructive, step-by-step methods, providing an alternative perspective.

### Framework Overview

The framework operates by iteratively filtering natural numbers using a sieve, systematically eliminating composite numbers. By structuring the prime selection process algorithmically, we can directly observe patterns and behaviors that classical number theory typically approaches through abstract proofs.

## Why This Argument is Likely to Be Rejected by Mathematicians

### Conventional vs. Unconventional Definitions

In classical number theory, a prime number is defined as an integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In this framework, primes emerge dynamically from a sifting process rather than being predefined objects with static properties.

### Formalism in Mathematics

Mathematical proofs require rigor and adherence to formal logic. The approach taken here, though logically sound, deviates from standard proof structures. Instead of proving existence through contradiction or generalization, it builds an explicit sequence of prime pairs through an iterative process, which may be seen as less rigorous by traditional standards.

## Sieve and Sifting Process

### Detailed Walkthrough

The sieve process is defined as follows:

```python
def sieve(P, N):
    return [n for n in N if all(n % p != 0 for p in P)]

print(sieve([2], list(range(2, 40))))
```

This function filters out numbers that are divisible by any number in the list `P`. By repeatedly applying this function and including the first remaining number into `P`, we dynamically construct the set of primes.

### Mathematical Intuition

The sifting process directly constructs the sequence of prime numbers by eliminating all composite numbers. Instead of relying on proofs based on divisibility, it provides an explicit method for generating primes, reinforcing their infinitude.

## Definition of Prime

In this framework, a prime is any number that remains after applying the sieve recursively, starting with an empty list of known primes. This contrasts with the classical definition but still produces the same sequence of prime numbers.

```python
def recursive_sifting(P, N):
    N = sieve(P, N)
    if not N:
        return P
    P.append(N[0])
    return recursive_sifting(P, N)

print(recursive_sifting([], list(range(2, 50))))
```

## Euclid's Proof (Reinterpreted)

### Historical Context

Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes is one of the earliest known proofs, showing that for any finite set of primes, there always exists another prime not included in that set. The classical approach involves assuming a finite set of primes, constructing a number by multiplying them and adding one, and demonstrating that this new number must be prime or have a prime factor not in the original set.

### Framework Interpretation

In this framework, the sifting process itself inherently guarantees that a new prime will always be found. Every step generates an infinite list of remaining numbers, ensuring that additional primes can always be selected.

```python
# NOT EXECUTABLE
# Euclid's Proof

# Inductive step 1
sieve([2], [n for n in range(2, float('inf'))])
# [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...]

# Inductive step 2
sieve([2, 3], [n for n in range(2, float('inf'))])
# [5, 7, 9, 11, ...]

# Assume there is a number k (resulting from sieve) that will not generate any further candidates.

# Inductive step k
sieve([2,3,5,7...,k], [n for n in range(2, float('inf'))])
# [5*7*11*...*k+1, 5*7*11*...*k*2+1, ...,5*7*11*...*k*n+1]

# Since k continues to generate infinitely many candidates that contradicted our assumption, we conclude that an infinite number of primes must exist.
```

### Twin Primes Proof

The twin prime conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by 2. Traditional approaches to proving this conjecture rely on deep number-theoretic tools such as sieve methods, analytic number theory, and probabilistic models. However, within our computational prime number framework, we take an alternative approach based on recursive sifting.

#### Defining Twin Prime Candidates

In our framework, twin prime candidates are initially generated through a sieve process that removes multiples of the first few primes:

```python
# NOT EXECUTABLE
sieve([2,3], N)
# [5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, 37]
```

The set of twin prime candidates can be generalized as:

`S({2, 3}) = { 6n +- 1 }`

This expression states that every twin prime candidate must be of the form 6n-1 and 6n+1 for some integer n, given that all primes greater than 3 conform to this structure.

At each step, we refine this set by eliminating numbers that can be decomposed into products of previously identified primes.

#### Constructing a Twin Prime Sieve

To rigorously identify twin prime pairs, we construct a sieve similar to the original but applied at the level of indices representing twin prime candidates:

```python
def twin_sieve(P, N):
    """
    Filters the list N for twin prime candidates based on divisibility tests.
    We exclude 2 and 3 because those numbers were used to generate the candidates.

    Parameters:
      P (list): A list of indices representing previously identified prime-related values.
      N (list): A list of natural numbers.

    Returns:
      list: A filtered list of numbers where both (6n-1) and (6n+1) pass the divisibility tests.
    """
    return list(filter(
        lambda n: all(
            (6*n + 1) % (6*p + 1) != 0 and
            (6*n + 1) % (6*p - 1) != 0 and
            (6*n - 1) % (6*p + 1) != 0 and
            (6*n - 1) % (6*p - 1) != 0
            for p in range(1, P[-1]+1) # Ensuring full composite elimination
        ),
        N
    ))
```

##### Example Usage:

```python
# Step 1: Initial filtration
candidates = twin_sieve([1], range(1, 50))
print("Twin prime candidate indices:", candidates)
print("Twin prime candidates:", [(6*c-1, 6*c+1) for c in candidates])

# Step 2: Further refinement
candidates = twin_sieve([1,2], range(1, 50))
print("Twin prime candidate indices:", candidates)
print("Twin prime candidates:", [(6*c-1, 6*c+1) for c in candidates])
```

#### Recursive Twin Sifting Process

We now construct a recursive function that continuously sieves twin prime candidates:

```python
def generate_pairs_from_indices(indices):
    return [(6*n-1, 6*n+1) for n in indices]

def twin_recursive_sifting(P, N):
    result = twin_sieve(P, N)
    if not result:
        return P
    return twin_recursive_sifting(P + [result[0]], N)

print(generate_pairs_from_indices(twin_recursive_sifting([1], list(range(1,50)))))
```

This process ensures that at each step, new candidates are identified while previously sieved numbers remain removed.

### Infinitude Argument for Twin Primes

Using the twin prime sieve, we now construct an inductive argument showing that twin prime pairs persist infinitely.

#### Inductive Steps

1. **Base Case**: Start with the smallest twin prime candidates:

   ```python
   twin_sieve([1], list(range(1, float('inf'))))
   # [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, ...]
   ```

2. **Next Iteration**: Apply the sieve process again:

   ```python
   sieve([2, 3], list(range(1, float('inf'))))
   # [3, 5, 7, 10, ...]
   ```

3. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that at step \( k \), we reach a stage where all numbers that can be sieved are removed.

4. **Inductive Step**: Consider an arbitrary remaining number \( k \), and define a utility function to compute its twin index:

   ```python
   def get_index(candidate):
       return (candidate-1)//6
   ```

   The sieve then produces the sequence:

   ```python
   sieve([2,3,5,7...,k], list(range(1, float('inf'))))
   # [get_index(6*(5*7*11*...*k)+1), get_index(6*(5*7*11*...*k*2)+1), ..., get_index(6*(5*7*11*...*k*n)+1)]
   ```

5. **Conclusion**: Since each step generates infinitely many additional candidates that are indivisible by previous steps, the process never terminates. Thus, twin primes must exist infinitely.

### Conclusion

Our argument is based on an alternative definition of primes derived from recursive sifting. The proof shows that the process always yields new twin prime pairs at each step, ensuring the infinitude of twin primes. While this approach diverges from conventional number theory, it provides an intuitive, computational framework for understanding prime persistence.
