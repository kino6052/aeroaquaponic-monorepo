# Computational Prime Number Framework

## Introduction

Here I present a conceptual framework that I call computational prime number framework. It is not the classical number theoretic framework, and therefore I don't claim to have proven anything within the standard framework. However, my adaptation is a fun thought experiment that allowed me to experiment with the infinitude arguments of twin primes and have fun in the mean time. It was an interesting experiment that helped me to look at prime gaps from a novel standpoint and it allowed to have prooves for longstanding conjectures only valid within the confines of my framework.

When I initially believed I had proven this conjecture, it was disheartening to discover that my work wasn't taken seriously by the mathematical community. I struggled to understand why mathematics—something I viewed as universally accessible to all minds—seemed restricted to an elite few. Isn't mathematics supposed to be a universal language available to anyone capable of logical thought?

Eventually, I realized my mistake: I had unconsciously assumed I was working within classical number theory, when in fact I had developed a proof within my own consistent conceptual framework. This crucial distinction had eluded me. I had forgotten that mathematics, like philosophy and other disciplines, operates within established frameworks with specific rules and conventions.

These frameworks began as thought experiments and explorations of human reasoning, but evolved into rigorous structures somewhat detached from their intuitive origins. While this evolution makes sense for formal advancement, we should remember that mathematics ultimately exists in human minds, not just in formal systems. It remains important to examine our foundational thinking and occasionally revisit first principles, ensuring we don't lose sight of what's truly fundamental in our pursuit of mathematical truth.
