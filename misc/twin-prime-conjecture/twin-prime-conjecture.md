# Computational Prime Number Framework

## Introduction

Here I present a conceptual framework that I call computational prime number framework. It is not the classical number theoretic framework, and therefore I don't claim to have proven anything within the standard framework. However, my adaptation is a fun thought experiment that allowed me to experiment with the infinitude arguments of twin primes and have fun in the mean time. It was an interesting experiment that helped me to look at prime gaps from a novel standpoint and it allowed to have prooves for longstanding conjectures only valid within the confines of my framework.

When I initially believed I had proven this conjecture, it was disheartening to discover that my work wasn't taken seriously by the mathematical community. I struggled to understand why mathematics—something I viewed as universally accessible to all minds—seemed restricted to an elite few. Isn't mathematics supposed to be a universal language available to anyone capable of logical thought?

Eventually, I realized my mistake: I had unconsciously assumed I was working within classical number theory, when in fact I had developed a proof within my own consistent conceptual framework. This crucial distinction had eluded me. I had forgotten that mathematics, like philosophy and other disciplines, operates within established frameworks with specific rules and conventions.

These frameworks began as thought experiments and explorations of human reasoning, but evolved into rigorous structures somewhat detached from their intuitive origins. While this evolution makes sense for formal advancement, we should remember that mathematics ultimately exists in human minds, not just in formal systems. It remains important to examine our foundational thinking and occasionally revisit first principles, ensuring we don't lose sight of what's truly fundamental in our pursuit of mathematical truth.

## Why This Argument is not Accepted by Mathematicians?

Mathematicians do not accept this argument primarily because it relies on unconventional definitions of primes and twin primes. In standard mathematical discourse, primes are defined within the established number-theoretic framework, and twin primes are understood through conventional properties of divisibility and modular arithmetic. While I argue that these definitions align with a rational understanding of primes—fundamentally as numbers surviving a sieving process—mathematics as a discipline adheres to strict formal rules. Thought experiments like this, which propose alternative definitions, are typically not considered serious arguments within the mainstream framework.

However, we must remember that mathematics is not some distant, immutable truth locked behind the walls of academia. It is, at its core, a construct of the human mind, something we can engage with, reason about, and even reinterpret. We do not need to rely solely on established doctrine to explore mathematical ideas; we can examine them personally and seek understanding through direct reasoning.

The primary objection to this argument is that it does not guarantee, at every step, that infinitely many primes or coprime pairs survive all iterations of the sieve. In the traditional framework, such a guarantee is essential to proving an infinite structure. However, this critique misunderstands the nature of the argument. I do not view primes as absolute entities existing independently, as if they were some kind of mathematical super-beings. Instead, they are relative—specifically, relative to the process of sieving. If we were to modify the rules of sieving, we would obtain different sets of "primes," whose infinitude would depend on the conditions imposed by our chosen process.

Therefore, while this perspective may not be accepted within the conventional mathematical framework, that does not mean it is invalid. It is a perfectly coherent and logical argument, even if it challenges traditional assumptions. If you can recognize its validity, you may also share the excitement of seeing a novel and intriguing way to approach this long-standing problem.

## The Twin Prime Sieve: A Computational Redefinition

### Overview of the Sifting Process

Rather than starting with the classical definition of a prime number, our approach defines primes as the emergent results of an iterative sifting process. The basic idea is to start with a list of natural numbers and remove all multiples of a set of known primes. For example:

- **S({2})** produces: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, …}
- **S({3})** produces: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, …}
- **S({2, 3})** produces: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, …}

The computational process iteratively builds a list of primes by repeatedly sifting out composite numbers.

### Python Implementation of the Sieve Function

The following Python function implements the sifting process. Given a list `A` of “primes” and a list `N` of natural numbers (ignoring 1), the function removes any number in `N` that is divisible by an element of `A`:

```python
def sieve(A, N):
    """
    Filters out numbers from N that are divisible by any element in A.

    Parameters:
      A (list): Known primes.
      N (list): List of numbers to filter (starting with numbers > 1).

    Returns:
      list: Numbers from N not divisible by any element in A.
    """
    return [n for n in N if all(n % a != 0 for a in A)]
```

### Iterative Prime Generation

Building on the sieve function, we can generate primes iteratively. Starting with an initial list `A = [2]`, we use the filtered list to choose the next candidate prime, add it to `A`, and repeat the process.

```python
def sifting_process(iterations, max_num=100):
    """
    Generates primes using an iterative sieve process.

    Parameters:
      iterations (int): Number of iterations to perform.
      max_num (int): Upper limit for the list of natural numbers.

    Returns:
      list: Primes obtained after the specified number of iterations.
    """
    N = list(range(2, max_num))  # Start from 2
    current_primes = [2]
    for _ in range(iterations):
        # Filter out multiples of current known primes
        N = sieve(current_primes, N)
        if not N:
            break
        # The smallest number in N is the next prime candidate
        current_primes.append(N[0])
    return current_primes

# Example usage:
print(sifting_process(5, max_num=100))
```

### A Note on Recursion

While recursion can be used to illustrate the process of continuously sifting numbers, it is important to note that Python’s recursion depth is limited. The following recursive version is provided for conceptual illustration only:

```python
def recursive_sieve(A, N):
    """
    Recursively applies the sieve function to generate primes.

    Parameters:
      A (list): Known primes.
      N (list): List of natural numbers (assumed infinite conceptually).

    Returns:
      list: Infinite conceptual sequence of primes (limited by recursion depth in practice).
    """
    N = sieve(A, N)
    if not N:
        return A
    # Add the smallest filtered number as the next prime
    next_prime = N[0]
    A.append(next_prime)
    return recursive_sieve(A, N)

# Due to Python's recursion limit, this is only illustrative.
```

## Revisiting Euclid’s Proof in a Computational Context

Euclid’s classical proof of the infinitude of primes relies on the idea that for any finite set of primes, one can construct a number that is not divisible by any of them. In our computational framework, we assert that the sifting process will never completely exhaust the set of natural numbers:

- With the initial step using {2}, filtering yields all odd numbers—a set of infinite cardinality.
- With the next step, using {2, 3}, the set still contains infinitely many candidates (e.g., numbers of the form 6n+1).

Thus, after any finite number of iterations, the filtered set remains infinite in theory. This iterative, computational reinterpretation of Euclid’s argument reinforces the classical conclusion: there are infinitely many primes.

Below is an elaborated explanation that integrates the twin prime conjecture into the computational primes framework. This version emphasizes the iterative sifting process and explains how—even as we sieve further—infinitely many numbers matching the twin prime form remain.

---

## Twin Prime Conjecture in the Computational Framework

The twin prime conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by 2. In our computational framework, twin primes emerge naturally when we reinterpret the sifting process. Instead of relying on classical definitions, we observe that after removing multiples of 2 and 3, the survivors are numbers of the form:

> **S({2, 3}) = { 2, 3, 6n ± 1 }**

This means that apart from the primes 2 and 3, every remaining number is either 6n – 1 or 6n + 1. Notice that for any natural number \( n \), the pair \((6n-1,\,6n+1)\) is a candidate for twin primes. Although subsequent sifting with additional primes may remove some candidates, the underlying structure guarantees that infinitely many such pairs persist.

### The Role of S({2, 3}) and Intervals of 6

Because the initial sieve S({2, 3}) removes numbers divisible by 2 and 3, we only need to examine the intervals in blocks of 6:

- **6n + 1:**  
  This number is not divisible by 2 or 3.
- **6n + 2, 6n + 3, 6n + 4, 6n + 6:**  
  At least one of these is divisible by 2 or 3 and thus removed.
- **6n – 1 (or equivalently, 6(n+1) – 1):**  
  Also survives the sieve.

Thus, the remaining numbers naturally fall into the form of twin primes.

### Infinitude Through the Iterative Sifting Process

Our computational framework uses an iterative process (or sieve) that mimics Euclid’s classic proof of the infinitude of primes. Here’s how it applies to twin primes:

1. **Step SP(2):**

   - Start with S({2, 3}), which produces all numbers of the form \(6n \pm 1\).
   - Since \( n \) can be any natural number, there are infinitely many numbers in each of the forms \(6n+1\) and \(6n-1\).
   - Consequently, there are infinitely many candidate twin prime pairs.

2. **Step SP(3):**

   - Next, apply the sieve S({2, 3, 5}).
   - The filtered set will contain numbers like \(2 \times 3 \times 5 \, n \pm 1\), which—while expressed in a slightly altered form—still preserves an infinite structure.
   - Again, for every \( n \), the structure guarantees twin prime candidates remain.

3. **General Inductive Step:**
   - Assume that after \( k \) steps, the sieve \( SP(k)=S(\{2, 3, \dots, p_k\}) \) leaves infinitely many numbers of the form:
     \[
     n \cdot (p_1 \times p_2 \times \dots \times p_k) \pm 1.
     \]
   - In the next step, adding \( p\_{k+1} \) eliminates only finitely many numbers, so infinitely many numbers of the same form still persist.
   - This inductive guarantee mirrors the classical analytic argument but is framed within our computational process.

### A Computational Bridge: The Twin Sieve Function

To further illustrate the computational approach, consider a modified sieve—called the _Twin Sieve_—that targets numbers representable as pairs \((6n-1, 6n+1)\). The idea is to apply a filtering function that ensures these pairs remain candidate twin primes.

Below is a Python function that demonstrates the concept. (Note that while this code is not optimized for performance, it clearly shows the idea.)

```python
def twin_sieve(A, N):
    """
    Filters the list N for twin prime candidates based on divisibility tests.

    Parameters:
      A (list): A list of indices representing previously identified prime-related values.
      N (list): A list of natural numbers.

    Returns:
      list: A filtered list of numbers where both (6n-1) and (6n+1) pass the divisibility tests.
    """
    return list(filter(
        lambda n: all([
            (6*n + 1) % (6*a + 1) != 0,
            (6*n + 1) % (6*a - 1) != 0,
            (6*n - 1) % (6*a + 1) != 0,
            (6*n - 1) % (6*a - 1) != 0
        ] for a in range(1, A[-1] + 1)),
        N
    ))
```

#### How It Works:

Here is a clear and precise definition of \( F \) for your article:

### Function \( F \) – Mapping Natural Numbers to Twin Prime Intervals

We define a function \( F \) that maps natural numbers to pairs of integers that represent potential twin prime candidates:

\[
F: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}
\]

\[
F(n) = (6n-1, 6n+1)
\]

```python
def F(n):
    """
    Maps a natural number n to a twin prime candidate pair (6n-1, 6n+1).

    Parameters:
      n (int): A natural number (n >= 1)

    Returns:
      tuple: A pair (6n-1, 6n+1) representing potential twin primes.
    """
    return (6 * n - 1, 6 * n + 1)

# Example usage: display F(n) for n = 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"F({i}) =", F(i))
```

This function expresses the fundamental structure of twin prime candidates after applying the sieve \( S(\{2,3\}) \), which leaves numbers of the form \( 6n \pm 1 \). The function \( F \) converts natural numbers into these pairs, allowing us to systematically examine and filter potential twin primes through the sifting process.

```python
import math

def candidate_number(n, primes):
    """
    Computes candidate numbers using the formula:
      candidate = n * (product of primes) ± 1.

    Parameters:
      n (int): A natural number multiplier.
      primes (list of int): List of prime numbers.

    Returns:
      tuple: (n * product + 1, n * product - 1)
    """
    product = math.prod(primes)
    return (n * product + 1, n * product - 1)

# Example usage:
primes_example = [2, 3, 5]
for n in range(1, 4):
    plus, minus = candidate_number(n, primes_example)
    print(f"For n={n} with primes {primes_example}: candidate = {plus} and {minus}")

```

- **Initial Step:**  
  With a starting set \( A \) (say, \( A = \{1\} \)), the twin sieve TS({1}) preserves numbers of the form \( n \times 6 \times F(1)[0] \times F(1)[1] \pm 1 \). This guarantees that these numbers are not divisible by the primes associated with \( F(1) \).

- **Subsequent Steps:**  
  When new indices (representing further primes) are added (for example, \( A = \{1, 2\} \), then \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \)), the structure of the sieve ensures that an infinite set of numbers remains. Each stage removes only a finite subset, leaving infinitely many candidates in the form:
  \[
  n \times 6 \times \prod\_{i=1}^{k}F(i)[0]F(i)[1] \pm 1.
  \]
  This reinforces the claim that twin primes are not exhaustible through the sifting process.

### Bridging Computation and Analysis

The classical proof of the infinitude of primes uses constructions like
\[
p_1 \times p_2 \times \dots \times p_n \pm 1
\]
to show that there is always another prime. In our computational framework, a similar guarantee is provided by the iterative sifting process: no matter how many primes are used to filter out candidates, there remain infinitely many numbers that take the form necessary for twin primes. The numbers \( n \cdot (p_1 p_2 \dots p_k) \pm 1 \) serve as an analytical guarantee—they demonstrate that our sieve will never eliminate every candidate pair.

While this guarantee is analytic, our approach also offers a computational perspective: even though some twin prime candidates might get removed in later iterations, at every step the sieve leaves behind an infinite set of numbers that fit the twin prime pattern. This disconnect between the computation (which might seem to “lose” some twin pairs) and the analytic guarantee (which confirms their infinite existence) is a key point of confusion that this framework helps to clarify.

### Concluding the Computational Twin Prime Proof

By integrating the twin sieve into our overall computational prime framework, we argue as follows:

- **For every finite set \( \{2, 3, \dots, p_k\} \) used in the sieve, infinitely many numbers remain in the form \( n \cdot (p_1 p_2 \dots p_k) \pm 1 \).**
- **These numbers, expressible as \( 6n \pm 1 \) in the initial step and in analogous forms in later steps, are precisely the structure that underpins twin primes.**
- **Thus, at each step of the sifting process, no matter how far we progress, there will always be infinitely many numbers that conform to the twin prime structure.**

This argument shows, in a computational context, why the process of iteratively filtering natural numbers never exhausts the possibility of finding twin primes. In other words, our sifting process is a computational embodiment of the twin prime conjecture: the infinitude of twin primes is preserved at every step.

### Conclusion

The twin sieve process in our computational primes framework is guaranteed to be never-ending. At each step, the process removes only a finite number of numbers—those divisible by the current finite set of primes—while always leaving behind an infinite subset of natural numbers. These survivors consistently take the form \(6n-1\) and \(6n+1\), as captured by the function

\[
F(n) = (6n-1, 6n+1).
\]

Because each sieving step only eliminates a finite portion of an infinite set, there will always be new pairs that have not been removed. This ensures that every iteration contributes a new candidate pair to the list. The inherent infinity of the natural numbers combined with the finite impact of each sieving operation means that the process never terminates and continues to generate new twin prime candidates indefinitely.
