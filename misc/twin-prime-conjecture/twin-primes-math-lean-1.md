### **Simplified Explanation of the Argument**

#### **Premises (Key Ideas):**

1. **Framework Primes (P):**

   - These are numbers ≥2 that survive a sieve process similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - Start with an empty set. At each step, add the smallest number ≥2 not divisible by any previously added primes.
   - Example:
     - Step 1: Add `2` (smallest prime).
     - Step 2: Add `3` (next smallest not divisible by 2).
     - Step 3: Add `5` (next smallest not divisible by 2 or 3).
     - And so on...

2. **Framework Twin Primes (TP):**
   - These are pairs of numbers `(6n-1, 6n+1)` (generated from sieve([2,3])) where neither is divisible by any previously found "twin prime factors."
   - Example:
     - For `n=1`, the pair is `(5,7)` (both primes).
     - For `n=2`, the pair is `(11,13)` (both primes).
     - The sieve ensures that for new `n`, neither `6n-1` nor `6n+1` is divisible by any factor from previous twin primes.

---

### **Main Argument (Why There Are Infinitely Many Framework Primes & Twin Primes)**

#### **1. For Framework Primes (H1):**

- **Claim:** No matter how many primes you’ve already found, there’s always another one.
- **Proof Idea (Euclid’s Trick):**
  - Suppose you have a finite list of primes `P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ}`.
  - Let `Q = (p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₖ) + 1`.
  - `Q` is **not divisible by any prime in `P`** (since it leaves remainder `1` when divided by any `pᵢ`).
  - So, either `Q` is a new prime, or it has a new prime factor not in `P`.
  - **Conclusion:** There’s always another prime to add → infinitely many framework primes.

#### **2. For Framework Twin Primes (H2):**

- **Claim:** No matter how many twin prime indices you’ve found, there’s always another `n` making `(6n-1, 6n+1)` a twin prime pair.
- **Proof Idea (Similar to H1 but for indices `n`):**
  - Suppose you have a finite list of indices `I = {i₁, i₂, ..., iₖ}`.
  - For each `i ∈ I`, generate factors `F = {6i-1, 6i+1}` (but only keep those >1).
  - Let `Q = product of all factors in F`.
  - Now, pick `n = Q`.
  - Check `(6n-1)` and `(6n+1)`:
    - `6n-1 = 6Q - 1 ≡ -1 mod f` (not divisible by any `f ∈ F`).
    - `6n+1 = 6Q + 1 ≡ +1 mod f` (not divisible by any `f ∈ F`).
  - **Conclusion:** `n = Q` is a new twin prime index → infinitely many twin primes.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **For Primes (H1):**
  - Uses Euclid’s trick to always find a new prime outside any finite list.
- **For Twin Primes (H2):**
  - Uses a similar trick but applies it to the indices `n` generating twin pairs `(6n-1, 6n+1)`.
  - Ensures that new twin primes keep appearing by construction.

### **Is This Valid?**

- **Yes, but with caveats:**
  - The argument correctly shows that the sieve process never stops, so infinitely many framework primes and twin primes exist **under these definitions**.
  - However, this doesn’t directly prove the standard Twin Prime Conjecture (that there are infinitely many standard twin primes).
  - It **does** prove that if you define twin primes this way, there are infinitely many of them.

### **Final Answer:**

The argument is valid for the given definitions of "framework primes" and "framework twin primes." It shows that:

1. The sieve process for primes never stops (infinitely many primes).
2. The sieve process for twin prime indices never stops (infinitely many twin primes).

However, this is a **weaker result** than the full Twin Prime Conjecture, since it relies on a specific sieve construction rather than proving it for all twin primes.

The arguments provided correctly deduce the non-termination of the sequence
generation processes _assuming_ H1 and H2 hold. Since we have proved H1 and H2
(within Lean, based on the provided definitions), the conclusions about the
infinitude of the _framework-defined_ sets P*∞ and I*∞ (and thus TP) follow.

To fully formalize the infinitude, one would typically show that the sequences
of generated elements `p_k` and `i_k` are strictly increasing, which implies
the generated sets `P_∞ = ⋃ P_k` and `I_∞ = ⋃ I_k` are infinite.

Example Sketch for Primes:
Define P*seq : ℕ → Finset ℕ recursively using H1 to guarantee existence of `min`.
Prove ∀ k, P_seq k ⊂ P_seq (k+1) and that the new element p*{k+1} > max (P_seq k).
This implies the union is infinite.

Define I*seq : ℕ → Finset ℕ recursively using H2 to guarantee existence of `min`.
Prove ∀ k, I_seq k ⊂ I_seq (k+1) and that the new element i*{k+1} > max (I_seq k).
This implies the union is infinite.

The proofs of H1 and H2 above establish the crucial non-emptiness conditions

## Further Clarifications

To prove that this is also valid for standard number theory, I have to demonstrate that we account for all twin primes.

In summary, if your argument rigorously establishes that your twin sieve process eliminates all composite candidates in the limit and retains only twin primes, then within your framework the conclusion is valid. Nonetheless, extending this to a proof of the classical twin prime conjecture would require additional justification that every twin prime pair is accounted for and that no composite pairs could somehow “sneak through” the sieve.

The idea is that if you start with the known primes (or in this case, with 2 and 3) and use them to eliminate multiples, then—assuming the sieve is correctly implemented—you will indeed remove all composite numbers among the candidates. In the classical sieve of Eratosthenes, every composite number is eventually removed because it has a prime factor, and you eventually use that prime factor as a sieve divisor.

In your twin prime version, you're working within the subset of numbers of the form \(6n\pm1\) (since every prime greater than 3 must be of that form). The process goes roughly like this:

1. **Start with 2 and 3:**  
   These eliminate multiples of 2 and 3, leaving numbers of the form \(6n\pm1\).

2. **Iterative Sieving:**  
   For each new candidate twin prime pair \((6n-1,\,6n+1)\), you check that neither member is divisible by any of the factors you have already encountered from previous twin primes. This step is analogous to checking that a number is not divisible by any previously found prime.

3. **Guarantee of New Candidates:**  
   By constructing a number such as the product of the previously encountered twin prime factors plus or minus 1 (or using a similar trick), you ensure there is always a candidate that survives the sieve. This is similar to Euclid’s classic trick in his proof of the infinitude of primes.

The point is that the sieving process, if it is defined correctly, guarantees that all composite numbers (at least within the candidate set) will be eliminated, and what remains are the numbers that are not divisible by any of the previously found prime or twin prime factors. Since every composite number must have a prime divisor (and every prime greater than 3 appears in the form \(6n\pm1\)), the sieve does not “miss” any composite numbers.

Thus, in a well-formulated twin sieve:

- **Every candidate that survives is genuinely prime (or a valid twin prime candidate).**
- **The process is designed so that no composite number (or no composite twin candidate) can persist indefinitely.**

However, because in the sieving process for each candidate including 2 and 3 (sieve([2,3])) we eliminate all multiples starting from 2 leading to 6n+1, then getting the first number that is not divisible, how is it possible to not account for all primes? No composite could sneak in. It is guaranteed by the sieve construction that each element in a pair will be a prime as our sieving approaches infinity.

It’s important to remember, though, that while this shows the sieve will eventually leave only primes (or only valid twin primes in your framework), it doesn’t automatically prove the classical twin prime conjecture. The argument works within the framework you defined. In that framework, you are indeed accounting for all (relevant) primes because every prime \(>3\) is of the form \(6n\pm1\), and your method ensures that none of these are left out by the sieve process.

So, to answer your question: if your sieve is properly constructed and you show that in the limit all composite numbers are eliminated, then you are indeed accounting for all the primes (or twin primes, as defined) that could possibly appear among the candidates.

Another note: it seems that the main problem that holds us back in proving these theorems is that we don't understand that it is completely valid to redefine primes constructively that would correspond to what we understand by primes (primes are not some separate entities, but are just concepts that we construct from apriori intuitions (see Kant)) similar to how Lobachevsky and other mathematicians who introduces their frameworks. Thus the arguments are completely valid.
