Based on the article and the definitions established for the "Computational Prime Number Framework", here are the core hypotheses that need to be proven _within that framework_:

1.  **Hypothesis 1: Non-Termination of Recursive Sifting (Infinitude of Primes)**

    - **Statement:** When the `recursive_sifting` process is initiated with `P = []` and a conceptually infinite list `N` of natural numbers greater than 1, the process never terminates. Specifically, at every step of the recursion, the call to `sieve(P, N')` (where `N'` is the list from the previous step) will always produce a non-empty list, guaranteeing that a `next_prime` can always be selected and added to `P`.
    - **Consequence (as claimed by the article):** Proving this hypothesis would demonstrate that the set of Prime Numbers (Generated Sense) generated by this process is infinite.

2.  **Hypothesis 2: Non-Termination of Twin Recursive Sifting (Infinitude of Twin Prime Indices)**

    - **Statement:** When the `twin_recursive_sifting` process is initiated with `P_indices = [1]` and a conceptually infinite list `N_indices` of natural numbers (`1, 2, 3, ...`), the process never terminates. Specifically, at every step of the recursion, the call to `twin_sieve(P_indices, N')` (where `N'` is the list of indices from the previous step) will always produce a non-empty list, guaranteeing that a `next_index` can always be selected and added to `P_indices`.
    - **Consequence (as claimed by the article):** Proving this hypothesis would demonstrate that the set of Twin Prime Indices generated by this process is infinite.

3.  **Hypothesis 3: Validity of Twin Prime Pairs (Implied by H2 & Definitions)**

    - **Statement:** Every Twin Prime Pair `(6n-1, 6n+1)` derived from an index `n` generated by the infinite `twin_recursive_sifting` process consists of two numbers that are prime according to the framework's definition (i.e., they would be included in the output of the standard `recursive_sifting` process if run sufficiently long).
    - **Note:** The framework seems to define these pairs as "twin primes" by virtue of surviving the `twin_recursive_sifting`. This hypothesis asserts that the `twin_sieve` function correctly filters out pairs where at least one member is composite (divisible by a previously identified prime generated via the `recursive_sifting` process, excluding 2 and 3). FAQ 13 attempts to justify this.

4.  **Hypothesis 4: Equivalence of Generated Primes to Conventional Primes**

    - **Statement:** The infinite set of Prime Numbers (Generated Sense) produced by the `recursive_sifting` process is identical to the set of prime numbers as defined in conventional number theory (integers `p > 1` whose only positive divisors are 1 and `p`).
    - **Note:** The article claims this equivalence (FAQ 12). Proving it rigorously would require showing both: (a) every number generated by the process is a conventional prime, and (b) every conventional prime will eventually be generated by the process.

5.  **Hypothesis 5: Equivalence of Generated Twin Primes to Conventional Twin Primes**
    - **Statement:** Every Twin Prime Pair `(p, p+2)` where `p` and `p+2` are conventional prime numbers (and `p > 3`) corresponds to a pair `(6n-1, 6n+1)` for some index `n` that would be generated by the infinite `twin_recursive_sifting` process. Conversely, every pair `(6n-1, 6n+1)` generated by the infinite `twin_recursive_sifting` process consists of two conventional prime numbers.
    - **Note:** This bridges the framework's output for twin primes to the conventional definition, combining Hypothesis 3 and extending it to full equivalence. FAQ 4 touches upon this convergence.

These hypotheses represent the core claims made in the article that require justification using logical arguments strictly based on the provided definitions and framework rules. Hypotheses 1 and 2 are central to the infinitude arguments presented. Hypotheses 3, 4, and 5 relate the framework's results back to conventional number theory definitions.
